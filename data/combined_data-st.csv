2024-02-06 09:52:57,Britain invests 100 million pounds in AI research and regulation,"  LONDON, United Kingdom - Britain on Tuesday, February 6, said it would spend more than 100 million pounds ($125 million) to launch nine new research hubs in artificial intelligence (AI) and train regulators about the technology.      ""AI is moving fast, but we have shown that humans can move just as fast,"" technology minister Michelle Donelan said in a statement. ""By taking an agile, sector-specific approach, we have begun to grip the risks immediately.""      Nearly 90 million pounds would go towards the hubs, which will focus on using AI in areas including healthcare, chemistry, and mathematics, and a partnership with the United States on responsible AI, the government said.      Another 10 million pounds would help regulators address the risks and harness the opportunities of AI, it said, such as developing practical tools to monitor risks in sectors from telecoms and healthcare to finance and education.      Britain hosted an international summit in November on AI safety.      More than 25 countries who attended  signed the ""Bletchley Declaration"",  which focuses on identifying risks of shared concern and developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/technology/britain-investment-ai-research-regulation/,Positive,['stocks' '' '']
2024-02-03 15:05:02,"As Citicore Renewable kicks off the 2024 IPO season, are we in for a greener year?","  MANILA, Philippines - In 2024, the grass is looking greener: not just because of market optimism, but because another renewable energy firm will kick off this year's initial public offering (IPO) season.       Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation  (CREC), headed by construction tycoon Edgar Saavedra, is set to be the first company to go public in 2024. The solar power firm's offer period is tentatively scheduled from March 11 to 15, with the listing date on March 22, according to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).      The company could sell up to 2.90 billion primary shares, with an overallotment option of 435 million secondary shares. Although the final offer price will be set on March 6, shares could be sold for up to P3.88 each.      In December 2023, CREC said that it would  use  P9.15 billion of its expected P10.75 billion net proceeds for the capital expenditure of its solar farms in 2024 and 2025. The rest will go to the development of its battery energy storage systems.      ""I welcome the decision of CREC to tap the equities market to raise capital since [renewable energy] projects are very much needed these days given that we are racing against time to address climate issues,"" PSE president and chief executive offer Ramon Monzon said.      More IPOs in 2024?      The listing of CREC could signal renewed vigor in a sleepy PSE, which saw just three companies going public in 2023.      The local bourse initially  targeted having 14 IPOs  in 2023, but that never materialized after challenging market conditions and elevated interest rates spoiled investor appetite.      But things could change in 2024.       In a report, First Metro Investment Corporation (FMIC) noted that Philippine equity investors ""launched 2024 with more optimism, sending the PSEi higher by 3.6% to 6,680.45 by mid-January."" With better macroeconomic conditions, softer inflation, and policy rate cuts on the horizon, FMIC said that the PSE index could hit as high as 7,500 in 2024.      Does a brighter market outlook mean more IPOs are on the way? FMIC's research head Cristina Ulang said that it's complicated.      ""Hard to predict,"" Ulang told Rappler on Friday, February 2. ""IPOs are hugely dependent on market conditions. Big issuers will move only when value turnover improves, which is still low now.""      Still, the PSE is dreaming big as it expects to  launch six IPOs  in 2024 - double what it had in 2023 - which could collectively raise about P40 billion in capital.      Rise of renewables      There's also another trend to look out for: the growth of renewable energy.      Just look at the sector in the PSE. Two of the three companies that went public in 2023 were focused on renewable energy -  Alternergy  and  Repower Energy Development Corporation . Alternergy kicked off the IPO season in 2023, and now Citicore Renewable is set to do the same in 2024.      Overall, the Philippines has already become the fourth most attractive emerging market for renewable energy investment, according to  BloombergNEF's 2023 Climatescope report . Investment in clean energy rose more than 40% between 2021 and 2022, hitting $1.2946 billion.      So what does the Philippines renewable energy transition have going for it?      ""The market stands out as one of the few that have implemented auctions, feed-in tariffs, net-metering schemes, tax incentives, and a strong target for renewable energy,"" BloombergNEF said in its report.      Meanwhile, FMIC's Ulang told Rappler that three factors are also among the key drivers of the green energy auction count in the Philippines:        Entry of foreign players      Partnerships given full liberalization of the industry and funding      Investment opportunities under the  energy transition mechanism  framework pioneered by Ayala Corporation Energy        The government has made strides in these areas. For instance, it has lifted ownership restrictions around clean energy,  welcoming 100% foreign-owned  renewable energy projects. Newly appointed Finance Secretary Ralph Recto also eyes setting up  carbon taxes  that could accelerate the shift to green energy.      All these efforts, a 2024 report by FMIC said, have gone towards the government's goal of ""attracting 3 gigawatts of new renewable energy investment from the private sector, a level that is more than the total clean energy installed over the past seven years.""      And if you ask Filipinos, the overwhelming majority - 85% -  agree that it is ""truly important""  to increase the use of renewable energy sources, a sentiment that cuts across social classes.      ""This is a sentiment in terms of favoring renewable energy sources, a sentiment that is shared by many Filipinos,"" Pulse Asia president Ronald Holmes said last November 13, 2023.      The government put up the framework, and the people support the cause. Now, the ball is in the court of big businesses to go green.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/citicore-renewable-first-initial-public-offering-2024/,Positive,['stocks' 'retirement' '']
2024-02-02 12:37:35,[In This Economy] Looks like PH economy will never get back on track. Here's the data.,"  For 2023, the Marcos administration aimed for economic growth between 6 and 7%.      But on January 31, the government reported that actual growth fell below that target, at just  5.6% . (Incidentally, the growth rate for the last quarter of 2023 was also 5.6%.)      Sure, that means our economy still expanded relative to 2022. But it certainly could have grown faster.      Figure 1 shows that there seems to be a downward trajectory of growth. The 5.6% in the fourth quarter is also lower than pre-pandemic times, when we came to expect at least 6% each quarter.                   Figure 1.       Growing at 5.6% also means that we may be locked in on a permanently lower growth path. That is, we will never get back to the pre-pandemic trajectory of total production.      Figure 2 shows that we need 10.3% growth per year if we want to go back to the pre-pandemic trajectory by 2028.      If, starting now, we just grow by 5 . 6% yearly, we will end up on the purple trend which is permanently below the yellow pre-pandemic trend.                   Figure 2.       Government officials like to say that  5.6%  makes us the fastest-growing country in this part of the world. That's only true if you look at the annual data. But Figure 3 shows that Vietnam's quarterly growth is steadily rising and reached 6.72% in the last quarter of 2023. That's a lot higher than our 5.6%. We're not quite number one.                   Figure 3.       Losing steam      In the post-pandemic world, the Philippine economy is supposedly bouncing back. And we sort of did, in 2021 and 2022. But in 2023, we lost steam.      Figure 4 shows that consumption, our biggest growth driver, has slowed down. The culprit is food spending growth, which essentially evaporated in 2023. This is likely due to the  spell of high inflation  since 2022: if prices are too high, Filipinos will think twice before buying a lot of foodstuff in  palengkes  or markets.                   Figure 4.       Investment spending also weakened a lot, particularly construction activities by households and corporations. This may have something to do with the elevated interest rates set by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas or BSP (as a way to temper inflation). Higher interest rates are like a chokehold on the economy; they make it costlier to finance new investments like construction projects.      This is why many analysts are closely watching the BSP's next moves, and eagerly awaiting the day when interest rates will drop again.      Another thing that weakened is government spending other than construction. Figure 5 shows that it all but vanished in 2023: out of 5.6% total growth, government spending contributed only 0.05 percentage point.      How come? Doesn't the government enjoy a larger budget every year?      Well, inflation also tends to eat away at the nominal budget of government. And slower public spending may have something to do with weak obligation and disbursement rates across agencies. In short, even agencies are having a hard time spending money, due to, say, procurement rules and regulations and lack of enough people to handle projects. That's a perennial problem of government that lingers to this day.                   Figure 5.       Weaker sectors      Weak economic growth is also mirrored by the data coming from the different sectors of our economy, namely agriculture, industry, and services.      Figure 6 showed that services, the biggest sectoral growth driver, slowed down a lot from 2022 to 2023. This is on account of weaker production in trade, transportation and storage, information and communication, and professional and business services. (One thing that's growing again is financial and insurance services.)                   Figure 6.       Industrial growth also faltered, thanks to weaker construction growth and, more crucially, weaker manufacturing growth. By end of 2023, manufacturing contributed just 0.35 percentage point to the 6.33% industrial output growth. Pitiful!      Agriculture, as always, contributed nearly nothing in 2023. Out of 5.6% yearly growth, agriculture accounted for just 0.1 percentage point. This isn't exactly new. There's still a lot to do so we can improve agricultural productivity.      Clearly, we need to fire up our sectors once again. But how?      The Marcos administration likes to point to the lack of investments, particularly foreign investments, in sectors like manufacturing. They even use this to justify moves to amend the 1987 Constitution and remove the supposedly restrictive economic provisions. But as I wrote last week, that's a  misleading narrative .      Moonshot      This is the first time that the Marcos government missed its annual growth targets.      Do you recall President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s first  State of the Nation Address ? He said there that GDP growth is targeted to fall between 6.5% and 7.5% in 2022. Actual growth for 2022, which clocked in at 7.6%, exceeded the target. They even touted that as the fastest growth rate in 46 years!      While true, I offered some  important caveats . For instance, that high growth reflects base effects (we were coming from such a low place in 2021) and revenge spending (people were cooped up in their houses for too long and wanted to go out and spend).      In 2023, data show that both base effects and revenge spending seem to have dissipated. So we're finally getting a truer picture of economic activity post-pandemic.      In Marcos' 2022 SONA, he said that the government expects economic growth to fall between 6.5% and 8% yearly from 2023 to the end of his term in 2028.      With the new 2023 data, that projection now sounds like a moonshot. Let's learn to manage our expectations in the coming years. -  Rappler.com         JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of   False Nostalgia: The Marcos ""Golden Age"" Myths and How to Debunk Them  .

2024-02-01 17:59:29,"OFWs want to be wiser with money, but finlit programs aren't reaching them","  MANILA, Philippines - Overseas Filipino workers want to be more financially literate, but the existing government programs made for OFW money management aren't communicated to them well enough, a new  report  from the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) found.      In a December 2023 report on the long-term effects of labor migration in the Philippines, PIDS pointed out how a ""lack of systemic financial literacy support"" makes OFWs vulnerable.      ""Results of primary data collected from interviews with select OFWs and their family members suggest that young OFWs dream of retiring early but may not be provided systematic support for financial literacy,"" the report said.      Several government initiatives are in place to boost financial literacy among OFWs. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has the  Pinansyal na Talino at Kaalaman (PiTaKa)  campaign, as well as the Land Bank of the Philippines' subsidiary Overseas Filipino Bank (OFBank).       The OFBank provides banking services that cater to specific needs of OFWs, like digital banking solutions that let OFWs avail of loans and bills payment services, as well as manage their accounts regardless of where they are.      But PIDS pointed out the need for better promotion of these programs and services.      ""The government has been providing some financial literacy programs and tried to provide better financial instruments for OFWs through the OFW Bank. The BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) has even established a unit that targets financial literacy for OFWs. The communication of government initiatives to improve the financial literacy and stability of OFWs has, however, not been systematic enough to make a solid impact,"" said PIDS.      In the fourth quarter of 2023, the BSP  found  that just 35.2% of OFW households were able to save remittances. Citing the World Bank, the BSP also  said  in November 2022 that just a quarter of adult Filipinos were knowledgeable in basic financial concepts.      Reinventing the wheel?      On Wednesday, January 31, the House committee on overseas workers affairs held a hearing to discuss proposed measures that hoped to enhance OFWs' financial literacy, including a free financial literacy training for OFWs.      Committee chair Kabayan Representative Ron Salo said that while lawmakers were aware of an existing financial literacy program with the OWWA, there was a need to institutionalize it.       ""Many until now have fallen victim to scams,"" said Salo in a mix of English and Filipino.      Department of Finance official Annabelle Gumimpan raised that while the DOF was supportive of financial inclusion programs for OFWs like the one under OWWA, there were already other programs under DOF's attached agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission's program to crack down on illegal lending and investment scams.      ""With regards [to] implementing the financial literacy campaign for the OFWs, I think we shouldn't have to duplicate, because… the BSP and the DMW (Department of Migrant Workers) already has a program, so there's no need for us to implement the wheel. And they're already implementing the program,"" Gumimpan said.      ""Precisely,"" replied Salo. ""Actually, you're right. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. But the [reality] now is how there really are a lot of OFWs who are not literate when it comes to finances. That's why we have this bill to make sure it becomes more effective. We will make the programs better.""      Salo said that awareness of the existing programs were lacking, noting that even some lawmakers inside the room were not informed of such programs as they were being discussed in the hearing.      ""So… how exactly is it effective?  Kasi kung effective na po ‘yung mga programs na ito, hindi na po natin kailangan pang pag-usapan po rito ,"" he said.

2024-02-01 15:50:17,"[OPINION] Maids, martyrs, murderers, and GomBurZa","  They are titles, labels, representations, and attempts to rewrite, or correct history. The attempts are not necessarily rooted in the events depicted but on current exigencies and what are demanded of audiences as determined by its writers, producers, and directors.      From   Maid in Malacanang   to   GomBurZa ,  in the titles alone it is obvious where this discussion might be headed. It could easily be about diametric differences, apples and oranges, fiction versus fact, or lies versus the truth. For many it should be obvious. Especially for those who had earlier watched Daryll Yap's  Maid in Malacanang  and   Martyr or Murderer  , and those who saw Pepe Diokno's  GomBurZa.       Maybe we shouldn't even go there as we risk insulting readers who would probably have gotten far better cinematic or political analysis from their barbers, hairdressers, and, on the aspect of politics, from veteran political commentators. To their learned and age-wizened skill at weaving through the schizophrenic maze of Philippine politics, we yield.      Realizing that the medium of entertainment teaches, we are compelled to widen our scope. The impetus? A recent gathering at a leading university's gymnasium to launch another anti-disinformation initiative organizers say had its roots on that fateful Tuesday hours after the voting public realized that Ferdinand R. Marcos had taken the presidency and was inevitably set to be proclaimed following the count of the Duterte-appointed officials at the Commission on Elections.      The launch simply added another flank to the ongoing initiatives led by private sector fact-checkers from those already within legitimate mainstream print and online media, to mushrooming non-government organizations and the long-fledgling yet brave and bold solo-flight radio, podcast, and YouTube opinion makers and op-ed writers who openly risk their lives to separate truth from lies in a society sunk deep in fake news.      As apparent as the disunity is among our leaders who see among themselves profound greed, ambition, and the need to perpetuate regardless of the demands of democracy or the statutory limitations established to avoid authoritarianism and autocracy, the diverse retelling of history in cinematic form ironically bears common objectives.      Rather than pick among starkly different versions, allow us to review common threads of the ""anti-disinformation"" theme.      As Hollywood has done to the most impressionable or, heaven forbid, the poorly educated undiscerning yet opinionated who would likely learn history from the silver screen than from the traditional teaching institutions like schools and universities, entertainment has been the most influential source of education. From epic biopics to musicals, simply add TikTok as a subset.      How many have read Hugo's  Les Miserables  and understood the French Revolution against those who watched Schonberg's abbreviated musical version of the 1832 Paris Rebellion or its 2012 movie production? How many Americans know of the Alamo if not for John Wayne in a coonskin cap as Davy Crockett in the 1961 film? Did Filipinos really know anything about US president Alexander Hamilton if not for the Broadway musical? Did Bonaparte witness the beheading of Marie Antionette as depicted in Ridley Scott's  Napoleon ? What subliminal message is imparted when Edu Manzano portrays Benjamin Magalong in the film   Mamasapano: Now It Can Be Told ?       Cinematic detail, from casting, costumes, and makeup, to sets, sideshows, and musical scores can ever-so-subtly enhance or alter from facts. Allow us to briefly present a few common caveats when employing as anti-disinformation tools non-traditional albeit profoundly effective popular educational media.      One, dramatizations are not meant to validate history. They are however, meant to inspire further discovery and perhaps from those that some validation might occur. While a motion picture's retelling of events are drawn from recorded or published history, dialogue, unless recorded, are likely interpretations.      This includes translations from the original, to encapsulated prose and modernized styles. Note that when Jerrold Tarog's   Heneral Luna   became a blockbuster, in the unavoidable interplay between viewers and the dramatization, falling prey to subliminal cognitive bias, pundits started freely quoting from its invective-laden script and extrapolating those to the current timeline and then invoking relevance.      Two, viewers cannot discount political motivations both from the incidents depicted in the timeline of the dramatization or from the current political environment. Politics is not only our national blood sport, for many there is little else that defines their lives.      Three, even with the benefit of hindsight, a balanced perspective is impossible as dramatizations are viewed with pre-conceived underlying bias and predispositions. Worse, a dramatization's authenticity is a function of the viewer's ability to discern fact from fiction, his capacity for critical thinking, the level of his communication skills, and as always, his personal circumstances, values, and principles.      So at the end of the day, just sit back, suspend reality, enjoy the movie, and please pass the popcorn.  - Rappler.com        Dean de la Paz is a former investment banker and managing director of a New Jersey-based power company operating in the Philippines.

2024-01-31 20:57:59,Anti-graft court allows dropping of 66 estafa cases vs former DOF official,"  MANILA, Philippines - After over a decade since she was indicted, the anti-graft court agreed to drop the 66 counts of estafa thru falsification of public documents charges filed by the Ombudsman against a former official of the Department of Finance.       In an Omnibus Motion filed last January 3, the Ombudsman told the Sandiganbayan that it wanted to withdraw the case against Charmelle Recoter, a former senior tax specialist of the DOF-One-Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center (DOF Center), as well as the rest of the co-accused in the case.      Recoter was named a co-defendant when former DOF officials were indicted on December 9, 2012  in relation to alleged unlawful transfer of tax credit certificates (TCCs) of oil companies.      Also charged then were the late Undersecretary and DOF Center executive director Antonio Belicena, other DOF officials, and executives of oil companies.      What led to the filing of the cases was a 1998 Senate investigation which found out that the DOF Center issued between P5.3 to 6 billion worth of falsified TCCs.       The Ombudsman's motion gave the anti-graft court the following reasons for intending to discontinue the case:        The Sandiganbayan dismissed in 2015 all cases against Pilipinas Shell-Treasury and taxation department general manager Pacifico Cruz;        The dismissal of cases against Petron Corporation vice president for marketing Celso Legarda based on the principle of  res judicata , which bars litigation of issues that have already been resolved with finality;      Back then, the Sandiganbayan also noted that a pair of separate Supreme Court rulings -  in 2007 and 2010 - had already determined that the oil firms involved transferred the TCC in good faith even though there were questions on the validity these instruments.  These tax credit certificates were  issued in favor of textile firms and bus companies which were later swapped for fuel.        The Ombudsman conceded in its motion that it could no longer convict the accused because the witnesses and documentary evidence it planned to present were rendered useless.      The prosecution also said that Ombudsman Samuel Martires allowed  the dropping of the cases.      The anti-graft court agreed with the futility of the proceedings and allowed prosecution to discontinue pursuing the 66 counts of estafa thru falsification of public documents it filed against Recoter.       Recoter surfaced on August 24, 2023 then posted a bail of  P70,000.       ""This Court deems it appropriate and practical to grant the Motion of the prosecution. It would be futile to proceed with the trial in these cases when the prosecution would not be able to present vital witnesses and evidence needed to put the accused on trial and convict them,"" said the Sandiganbayan First Division.      In 2021, the Sandiganbayan also junked 44 counts of graft and 46 counts of estafa thru falsification of  public documents related to the multi-billion pesos TCC scam.  The reason was that all of the prosecution's  witnesses were either dead or could not be found.  - Rappler.com  ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/sandiganbayan-allows-dropping-estafa-cases-against-former-department-of-finance-official/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-31 10:15:05,"Philippines falls short of 2023 GDP target, growing 5.6%","  MANILA, Philippines - The Philippines'  gross domestic product (GDP) growth  fell to 5.6% in 2023 - below the government target of 6% to 7%.      The full-year GDP growth for 2023 is much lower than the 7.6% notched in 2022, which made the Philippines the fastest-growing economy in Southeast Asia that year.      The Philippine Statistics Authority also reported on Wednesday, January 31, that fourth quarter growth for 2023 was at 5.6%. In the same quarter in 2022, growth reached 7.1%.      The country's GDP growth of 5.9% in the  third quarter of 2023  had been the fastest in the region, driven by a surge in government spending that compensated for slower domestic consumption.      Despite economic growth missing the government's target, the Philippines remains one of the best performing economies in Asia, among those that have already released their fourth-quarter figures. Here's a rundown of the countries mentioned by National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio Balisacan:        Vietnam – 6.7%      Philippines – 5.6%      China – 5.2%      Malaysia – 3.4%        Growth for the year had to contend with rising prices as average inflation for 2023 hit 6%, far above the 2% to 4% target of the government.      In response, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has taken a hawkish stance, raising its  key policy rate . But though rate hikes can be a tool to bring inflation under control,  economists warned  that excessive hikes could affect GDP growth as consumers and businesses find it more expensive to borrow money.      Diving deeper      Among major industries, services led growth for the full-year 2023 at 7.2%, while industry grew by 3.6% and agriculture, forestry, and fishing by 1.2%.      Similarly, services contributed the most to the 5.6% GDP figure, with it responsible for 4.4 percentage points. Industry contributed 1.1 percentage points while agriculture, forestry, and fishing contributed just 0.1 percentage points.      Meanwhile, government spending contracted by 1.8% in the fourth quarter after growing by 6.7% in the third quarter. Recall that government spending  shrank by 7.1%  in the second quarter as well. Because of the underspending, government expenditures grew by only 0.4%.      Government spending is a crucial component of economic growth. However, the limited growth in government spending is partly intentional, as Balisacan explained that they ""decided to go for fiscal consolidation  kaya  (so) it was intentional  na hindi mataas ‘yung growth ng government spending for 2023  (that growth in government spending for 2023 wasn't that high) because we want to achieve fiscal consolidation, which means lowering the fiscal deficit [and] government debt.""      With regard to inflation, Balisacan said he's also concerned about the low growth in food spending due to high food prices.      ""We need to relentlessly manage elevated food prices, particularly improving the efficiency and resiliency of the agricultural food chain,"" he said.      Although the economy didn't grow as fast as the government expected it to in 2023, the Philippines' chief economist said it has to be assessed against the backdrop of the country's pandemic recovery.      Since  shrinking by 9.5%  in 2020, the Philippine economy is now 8.6% higher than pre-pandemic levels.      ""As of Q4 2023, at least  nakabalik na ang ekonomiya doon sa GDP ng  (the economy has reached the GDP level of) 2019,"" Balisacan said. ""We practically lost three years of economic growth.""      A missed target      The economy had to grow at least 7.2% in the fourth quarter to hit the low end of the 6% to 7% target set by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s economic managers, according to the Department of Finance (DOF).      Back in November when the third-quarter figure was released, the DOF remained firm that the country would end the year close to its growth targets.      ""We are confident that the country will post a full-year economic growth that is close to the low end of the DBCC's (Development Budget Coordination Committee) growth assumptions of 6% to 7% for 2023 as inflation eases, labor market conditions remain strong, and consumer spending increases, particularly during the holiday season,"" said then-finance secretary Benjamin Diokno, who has since been  replaced by Ralph Recto .      Earlier, the Asian Development Bank also lowered its  2023 GDP growth forecast for the Philippines  to 5.7%, which is below the government target, citing inflation worries.      First Metro Investment Corporation also expected the economy to fall below target in 2023, forecasting a 5.5% GDP growth rate. However, looking ahead, FMIC predicts 2024 could see stronger growth of 6%, pointing to record unemployment lows, the  slowest inflation  in 22 months, and strong infrastructure spending.      For 2024, the economic team targets GDP to grow 6.5% to 7.5%.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-philippines-q4-2023/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-31 08:57:19,Judge voids Elon Musk's ‘unfathomable' $56-billion Tesla pay package,"  WILMINGTON, USA - A Delaware judge on Tuesday, January 30, ruled that Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package could be tossed, calling the compensation granted by the EV maker's board ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders.      Shares of Tesla dropped about 3% in extended trade.      The ruling may sweep away the largest pay package in corporate America. The judge found it was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to their headline-making CEO, one the world's richest people, and the promise of allowing him to share in the company's enormous growth.      ""Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside,' or perhaps starry eyed by Musk's superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?"" wrote Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery.      McCormick's opinion directed the Tesla shareholder who challenged the pay plan to work with Elon Musk's legal team on an order implementing the decision. The decision can be appealed once the parties agree on a final order and on fees for the shareholder's attorneys, which will be paid by Tesla.      ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" Musk said in a post on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022. Originally named Twitter, Musk moved its state of incorporation to Nevada from Delaware after his purchase.      Musk's lawyer did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.      ""Good day for the good guys,"" said an email from Greg Varallo, an attorney for the Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the lawsuit in 2018.      The ruling can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.      ""The incredible size of the biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum - seems to have been calibrated to help Musk achieve what he believed would make ‘a good future for humanity',"" wrote McCormick in her 201-page opinion.      Musk testified during the compensation trial in November 2022 that the money would be used to finance interplanetary travel.      ""It's a way to get humanity to Mars,"" he testified. ""So Tesla can assist in potentially achieving that.""      Tesla's agreement with Musk contributes a significant part of his fortune, which according to Forbes magazine was $210.6 billion, just ahead of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault of France and his family.      The ruling will put the spotlight on Tesla's next round of compensation negotiations with the CEO. Musk said in a post on X in January that he was uncomfortable leading Tesla unless he had 25% of the voting control. The billionaire owned around 13% of the company at the time and he said negotiations would not start until the McCormick had ruled.      ""Given the way she describes the board process - through the testimony of the directors - there is no way that his most recent demand for 25% can get approved,"" Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said. ""It's dead on arrival.""      Tesla directors argued during a week-long trial that the company was paying to ensure one of the world's most dynamic entrepreneurs continued to dedicate his attention to the electric-vehicle maker. Antonio Gracias, a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021, called the package ""a great deal for shareholders"" because he said it led to the company's extraordinary success.      Tornetta's lawyers argued the Tesla board never told shareholders that the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package.      The plaintiff's legal team also argued the board had a duty to offer a smaller pay package or look for another CEO and that they should have required Musk to work full-time at Tesla instead of allowing him to focus on side projects, like SpaceX and X.      The package grants stock option awards allowing Musk to buy Tesla stock at heavily discounted prices as escalating financial and operational goals are met.      He must hold the acquired stock for five years.      Musk qualified for all 12 tranches or performance targets in the plan. He was not guaranteed any salary.      Tesla's value ballooned to briefly top $1 trillion in 2021 from $50 billion when the package was negotiated.      Amit Batish at Equilar, an executive pay research firm, estimated in 2022 that Musk's package was around six times larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid executives in 2021.      In July, Tesla's directors agreed to return $735 million to the company to settle shareholder allegations brought in a separate lawsuit filed in 2020 that they overpaid themselves. The lawsuit challenged options that were granted to directors starting in June 2017.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/technology/judge-voids-elon-musk-unfathomable-tesla-pay-package/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-30 22:30:01,"In New Zealand, OFWs also endure ‘endo-like' work conditions","  MANILA, Philippines - December 20, 2023, started out as just another day for ELE Group workers in New Zealand.      They had their uniforms on and were ready to go to their respective workplaces - in construction or as assistants to carpenters.       But that morning, according to Filipino worker Nelson (not his real name), he and his fellow hammerhands in ELE based in Hamilton, a city in New Zealand, received messages not to go to work. They were told management was set to hold a meeting where something ""important"" was to be discussed.      Hours later, they learned that they had lost their jobs.      Just before Christmas, around 500 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in New Zealand lost their jobs when labor-hire and recruitment firm ELE Group went under receivership. While accounting firm Deloitte, the receivers of the ELE Group's companies, estimates around 500 Filipinos were affected, the actual number could be up to more than 700, according to an  open letter  from the workers.      For weeks, the OFWs relied on community donations, while some slept in their cars. According to Deloitte, none of the workers have received their final pay as of posting. Some have already signed contracts for new jobs.      According to Investopedia, when a company is in  receivership , it is placed under control of a trustee because it could not meet its financial obligations. A receivership is a measure that could prevent a company's looming bankruptcy.      The receivership of ELE Group was what put the OFWs out of work. But just working for a labor-hire company already puts OFWs in an unstable position. This situation is similar to how thousands of Filipino workers in the Philippines experience labor contractualization.      Jobless in a day      At 35, Nelson had been on his 10th year as an OFW when he arrived in New Zealand in 2023. He learned of the opportunity to work in ELE through a friend in the Philippines. Because ELE was a labor and recruitment agency, its contract workers did not work for ELE itself, but instead for companies that the agency contracted them out to. The two companies where Nelson worked had good pay and a schedule that allowed him to rest.       Nelson earned NZD$27 per hour, from 7 am to 5 pm, which meant he normally earned around $1,282 in a week, or P44,344.      Back home in Cavite province, he has a wife and two young daughters, whom he was able to send up to P20,000 every week.       While his family in the Philippines was able to save a portion of his remittances, most of what he kept for himself ran out quickly because of the high cost of living in New Zealand. That's why when ELE announced to the workers that they were closing and could not give their salary for the week, the Filipinos were left high and dry.      "" Sobrang lungkot po. Siyempre, ang unang pumasok po sa isip namin is 'yung... Alam 'nyo naman po, ‘pag magpa-Pasko, maraming plano. Lahat po 'yun is gumuho bigla nang sinabi po sa amin, nang marinig namin na mawalan na kami ng trabaho at sarado na ang kanilang kompanya ,"" said Nelson in an interview with Rappler.      (We were tremendously saddened. Of course, the first thing that went into our minds was... You know, when Christmas is coming, you have a lot of plans. All of that was gone in a snap when they told us, when we heard, that we would lose our jobs and their company was closing.)      In the weeks of unemployment, workers' union FIRST Union and OFW rights group Migrante Aotearoa, both based in New Zealand, helped the workers get by through food packs given to them. It took some weeks before the Philippine government shelled out financial support.        FOOD DRIVE. Retrenched workers at the FIRST Union's Noche Buena Food Drive in Auckland. Photo courtesy of Migrante Aotearoa       No job security      Around half of the Filipinos affected by the receivership were contract laborers in construction, according to Dennis Maga, general secretary of FIRST Union. The union, composed of 30,000 workers from the finance, industries, retail stores, and transportation (FIRST) sectors across New Zealand, is assisting the laid off workers in talks with Deloitte.      When ELE recruits its workers, they work for various construction, logistics, and healthcare firms, which are called their ""economic employers.""       There is no employer-employee relationship between the ELE workers and their economic employers, Maga said. Nelson also said that the contracts he had were only with ELE.      ""We were only supplied to the companies. So we could be pulled out any time. But it also depends on if the company likes us, so they can absorb us and take us from ELE,"" Nelson said in Filipino.      If what Nelson described sounds familiar, it should very well be. His situation, as well as those of the rest of the ELE workers, mirrors contractualization as we know it in the Philippines. Labor contracting agencies in the Philippines employ workers who are contracted out to clients for a period of usually not more than six months. One can usually find them in security, maintenance, and food service jobs.      This practice is also known here in the Philippines as ""endo,"" a play on the phrase ""end of contract."" Because their jobs last only until the end of their contracts, there is no security of tenure nor benefits. Exploitative companies hire these fixed-term employees and  continuously renew their contracts  to avoid giving the benefits that a regular worker is lawfully entitled to.      Time and again, various administrations have  tried to end the practice of ""endo"" in the Philippines.  In both chambers of the current 19th Congress, bills looking to end abusive forms of contractualization and strengthen workers' rights to security of tenure stagnate at the committee level.      According to Maga, labor-hire companies in New Zealand can have even ""worse"" operations than the months-long contracts that are common in the Philippines, because they employ workers for periods of two months, or even just two days.      Receivership explained      In an interview with Rappler on Tuesday, January 30, David Webb, one of ELE's receivers from Deloitte, said that the company went into receivership because it had ""run out of cash.""      Webb said that as ELE lost business over months, the company reached out to several parties in a bid to acquire funding, and explored the possibility of selling the company. But both of these attempts were unsuccessful, leading the company to request that a receiver be appointed.       Webb and Robert Campbell  were asked to be receivers of the company just days before it shut down. They were appointed as receivers in the morning of December 20, the same day the workers were told that the company was folding.      As receivers, Webb and Campbell assess whether the business can continue to trade. They look for opportunities to sell the business, and in the event they are unable to, they strive to dispose of the assets and distribute monies in accordance with New Zealand law.      As a labor-hire company, ELE's main assets were its workforce. Since the company could no longer pay them, the receivers needed to terminate their employment and get final payments from ELE's clients, or the economic employers.      Webb said that while it was technically possible for the company to bounce back and rehire, it was unlikely, since its former workers had already begun seeking new employment.      ""What it would take for that to occur would be for the receiver to have paid back all of the debts so that the company had returned to solvency, and then the company would then be returned to the director at that point for them to continue to trade... Whilst that is technically possible, it is highly unlikely in this situation, given the workforce that's moved on and also the level of the debts that [the] ELE Group [has],"" said Webb.      Webb explained that the collection of the final pay from ELE's clients was ""slower than [they] would have hoped"" due to the holidays. Maga also explained that New Zealand was a ""laid-back"" country that took holidays seriously. Webb said that ELE's clients were only starting to come back to work in the recent days.      In one to two days, Deloitte expects to inform the workers of the respective final payments owed to them. Payments may be released after that, though Webb said the timeframe had yet to be finalized.      Attractive working conditions, despite job insecurity      According to Maga, FIRST Union observed that ELE Group paid its workers relatively well compared to other labor-hire companies. Some workers earned NZD$36 an hour - and if one were to multiply that with eight hours a day for five days a week, the total would be $1,440 in a week, or around P49,810.      "" Kaya ang dami talaga na gusto lumipad sa kanila  (That's why many workers really want to go abroad for them),"" said Maga.      Many Filipinos want the work, and the feeling is mutual with construction recruiters. Maga said that Filipino workers are in demand because they ""speak English well, work quickly, and learn quickly.""      Maga said that ELE recruited many Filipino workers because of the good business they gave - what he called the ""labor-hire scheme."" The workers whom the union is assisting were offered 30 hours of guaranteed work. If a worker's given salary was $27 an hour, Maga explained, labor-hire companies could charge their economic employers $55 an hour, which would give them a $28-profit margin.      "" Kaya isang magandang negosyo din sa kanila ‘yan. Kaya gustong-gusto nila mga Pilipino dahil sa ganyang scheme  (That's why it was so profitable for them. They wanted Filipinos so much because of that scheme),"" he said.      According to industry research firm  IBISWorld , there are over 1,000 labor-hire companies in New Zealand as of 2024.      Webb said that ELE belonged to a small group of struggling labor-hire companies, but the industry was mostly afloat and continued to grow.      ""Even if a labor-hire company says they can no longer employ you, OFWs have the option to find new jobs to keep their work continuous. That's the advantage of the many Filipino workers, because the labor market is in their favor,"" said Maga in a mix of English and Filipino.      As of writing, Nelson has been able to find new work. Apart from the community support over the past weeks, he and some others were able to get by with financial assistance that the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers gave them on January 16.                       From Our Archives                          Why contractualization is bad for everyone, not just for workers                                                                                        Longer tenure: A win for employee and employer      According to Maga, while a business can potentially save from the non-renewal of contract workers, they can also lose productivity by letting go of experienced workers.      ""That's why some employers who recruit OFWs are proposing that they be given work visas with longer validities. Not just one year, two years, or three years - they want it at five years. And the good thing about New Zealand is that the government listens,"" Maga said, adding that policymakers were aware of the six-month contractualization practice in the Philippines.      Maga also said that many Filipinos in New Zealand were ""sick and tired"" of contractualization, which is what led them to go abroad. For Nelson, it was both the job insecurity and the low salaries that pushed him to seek better opportunities abroad.      "" Kung magkakaroon man tayo ng trabaho sa Pilipinas, sana baguhin nila ‘yung law o ‘yung batas na six months contract. Kung hanggang maaari, mas pahabain pa po sana nila para hindi na po mahirapan ‘yung mga kababayan natin na maghanap ulit ng panibagong trabaho ,"" said Nelson.      (If we were to have jobs in the Philippines again, I hope they change the law to prevent six-month contracts. They should make it longer so that workers like us don't have to deal with the difficulty of finding new jobs.)  - Rappler.com        NZD$1 = P34.59   ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/new-zealand-ofws-endure-endo-like-work-conditions/,Negative,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-30 11:58:21,Pokwang says Lee O'Brian filed for voluntary deportation. Here's a timeline of their relationship.,"  MANILA, Philippines - Filipino host-comedian Pokwang - whose real name is Marietta Subong - disclosed that estranged partner Lee O'Brian has filed a motion for voluntary deportation, more than a month after she won the deportation case against him.       In an Instagram post on Saturday, January 27, Pokwang shared that she recently found out that O'Brian had filed a motion for voluntary deportation on January 10. However, she was quick to mention that her camp doesn't have a copy of the motion yet.       She also revealed that O'Brian had filed for a motion for reconsideration on December 28, 2023, just a few weeks after the Bureau of Immigration granted her petition for the deportation of her ex-partner.              .igframe iframe{ background: white;  max-width: 540px;  width: calc(100% - 2px);  border-radius: 3px;  border: 1px solid rgb(219, 219, 219);  box-shadow: none;  display: block;  margin: 0px 0px 12px;  min-width: 326px;  padding: 0px; height: 967px; } @media screen and (max-width: 760px){ .igframe iframe{ height: 710px; }u }             "" Buo ang tiwala ko na sa amin pa rin papanig ang hustisya dahil nasa aming panig ang katotohanan. Aaminin ko na napakahirap ang pinagdadaanan kong ito - may mga araw na napapangunahan ako ng inis at galit. Frustrated ako dahil gusto ko nang mapaalis si Lee sa ating bansa sa lalong madaling panahon,""  she added.       (I have full trust that justice will prevail since we know the truth. I admit that what I'm going through is very difficult -- there are days where I'm overridden by my anger. I feel frustrated because I want Lee to be out of the Philippines as soon as possible.)       With this latest development, we look back at some key moments of Pokwang's relationship with estranged partner Lee O'Brian:       2014      Pokwang and Lee O'Brian met while working together in the 2014 movie  Edsa Woolworth.  They entered a relationship in early 2015.              .igframe iframe{ background: white;  max-width: 540px;  width: calc(100% - 2px);  border-radius: 3px;  border: 1px solid rgb(219, 219, 219);  box-shadow: none;  display: block;  margin: 0px 0px 12px;  min-width: 326px;  padding: 0px; height: 967px; } @media screen and (max-width: 760px){ .igframe iframe{ height: 710px; }u }             2018      Pokwang  gave birth  to her first child, a daughter named Malia, with O'Brian in January 2018. They first confirmed the actress' pregnancy in June 2017.       In 2015, Pokwang was also pregnant with Lee's child, but she suffered a miscarriage.       2022      In July 2022, Pokwang  confirmed  that she and O'Brian have ended their six-year relationship. Speculations about their split circulated after netizens noticed that the actress changed the brand name of their food business from ""Pok-Lee"" to ""Mamang Pokwang.""       In an exclusive interview with  PUSH,  the comedienne also disclosed that they have been separated since November 2021, but emphasized that they remain on good terms.       ""We're okay. No third party involved and we're both co-parenting  kay  Malia.  Maayos naming tinapos ang lahat. Hindi kami pait-paitan  (We finished everything amicably. We're not bitter with each other),"" she said, adding that they only got ""tired"" of the relationship.       In a separate interview with  GMA News,  she also defended O'Brian from the bashing he's receiving on social media.        ""Sana ang alam ng tao na ang hinuhusgahan ninyo na si Lee O'Brian ay mabuting tao naman po. Mabuting ama. Nasasaktan lang ako sa mga nababasa ko na kesyo palamunin ko daw. Masipag po ‘yung tao,""  she said.       (I hope that the people will know that the Lee O'Brian they're judging is a good person, a good father. I'm getting hurt with what I'm reading as these comments say that he's leeching off me. He's hardworking.)       In September 2022, Pokwang was  present  during O'Brian's birthday celebration.       2023      However, tides started turning by 2023 as Pokwang continued to further speak up about their separation.       In January 2023, the actress made several  revelations  about their breakup, disclosing that she kicked him out of her house, and that he has not given child support to their daughter Malia since she was born.       "" Nagising lang ako sa katotohanan na anim na taon ko na pala siyang palamunin at limang taon (nang) walang child support,""  she replied to a netizen who commented on her relationship with O'Brian. It was also this time when she first hinted that she's having a legal battle with her former partner.       Pokwang also alluded that during this time, O'Brian was already  seeing someone new.        In a February 2023 guest appearance in   Fast Talk With Boy Abunda   ,  Pokwang opened up about their fallout, revealing that a confrontation about their business venture caused them to end their relationship.      The comedienne shared that as the person who financed their business, she just wanted to know about the financial status of their ventures.       "" Nagpapa-update lang naman ako sa kanya na, feeling ko, karapatan ko 'yon.... Halos one year na akong walang naririnig.... 'Nung last month, ito ang gastos natin.' Yun lang naman ang hinihingi ko.... Hindi niya nagustuhan. Parang ang dating sa kanya, hinuhusgahan ko na siya agad,""  she said.       (I was just asking for updates since I think that's also my right.... I haven't heard any updates from him about this for a year.... 'Last month, we had this much expenses' -- that's what I'm just asking for. He didn't like it. For him, it felt like I was already judging him.)       An emotional Pokwang also admitted that she was hoping that she and O'Brian could still fix their relationship as she wanted their daughter Malia to have a complete family.       "" Umaasa ako na aayusin pa niya.... Oo, naghiwalay kami pero marami akong binigay na chance,""  she said. (I was hoping he'll fix it. Yes, we broke up but I gave him numerous chances.)       She also continued that she's no longer interested in reconciling her romance with O'Brian. "" Feeling ko hindi niya ako minahal talaga  (I feel like he didn't really love me at all),"" she said.       In June 2023, Pokwang revealed that she was  filing the petition  for deportation against the father of her child Malia  ""para sa karapatan ko at ng anak ko, para sa mga kapwa ko babae at sa bayan ko  (for my rights, and my child's rights, for my fellow women, and for my country).""      Also in June 2023, O'Brian  filed a counter affidavit  against Pokwang's petition for deportation, emphasizing that he had always ""put the best interest [of their] daughter first,"" and appealed to the local authorities to look at his case ""fairly and with justice.""       In December 2023, Pokwang's lawyer Ralph Calinisan said that the Bureau of Immigration (BI) has ordered the  deportation  of O'Brian for ""violating the terms and conditions of his Philippines stay."" The BI also included O'Brian in their black list, canceled his pre-arranged employment visa, and issued a Warrant of Deportation.      2024      Despite winning the deportation case, the comedian was still going on a tirade against her ex-partner. At one point, Pokwang claimed that O'Brian was still in the Philippines because of his  connections . She also  lamented  that he's only acting as a dad to their daughter for social media.       In her January 27 post, after disclosing that O'Brian filed for a motion for voluntary deportation, Pokwang then expressed her gratitude to those who helped her in her case. She also apologized to government officials, explaining that some of her comments were brought upon by heightened emotions.       "" Valid man, hindi ito sapat na dahilan para makapagsabi ako ng mga masakit at walang basehan na bagay sa aking kapwa,""  she wrote. (While my feelings are valid, it's still not enough reason for me to say words that are hateful and have no basis about other people.)""

2024-01-29 10:42:24,Malaysia ex-finance minister charged with failing to declare assets,"  KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Malaysia on Monday, January 29, charged a former finance minister for failing to comply with a notice to declare assets under the country's anti-corruption laws, amid a crackdown on graft involving prominent political and business figures.      Daim Zainuddin, 85, a key ally of former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Daim faces a maximum jail term of five years and can be fined up to 100,000 ringgit ($21,159.54).      Daim, who served as finance minister from 1984 to 1991 and from 1999 to 2001, entered court on Monday in a wheelchair and his lawyer cited health issues when asking for bail.      Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who campaigned on a reformist platform, has vowed to tackle high-level corruption but has faced accusations of using the country's anti-graft agency to target political rivals. Anwar has said he does not interfere in the agency's investigations.      Daim was charged following an investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) into the former minister based on information contained in the Pandora Papers - a massive leak of financial records in 2021 that revealed offshore assets held by politicians and public figures worldwide.      The MACC last month seized Ilham Tower, a 60-story building in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, as part of its probe into Daim.      Daim's wife, Na'imah Abdul Khalid, was also charged in court last week for failing to disclose assets to the anti-corruption commission. She pleaded not guilty.      Daim has described the probe against him as a ""political witch-hunt"" led by the anti-graft agency and Anwar, who succeeded him as finance minister in 1991.      The MACC said last month it had acted independently according to the law when opening investigations against Daim in February 2023.      Anwar and Mahathir have been locked in a decades-long off-on rivalry that saw Anwar, a one-time protege of the elder statesman, jailed for sodomy and corruption, charges he said were politically motivated.      Anwar was pardoned and became prime minister in 2022, after more than two decades as an opposition leader, vowing to combat corruption and focus on the economy.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-ex-finance-minister-daim-zainuddin-charged-failing-declare-assets/,Neutral,['stocks' 'loans' '']
2024-01-28 11:43:10,"Mathematician says audit of PCSO lotto, not statistics, can check for cheating","  MANILA, Philippines - The odds of the PCSO lotto games being won successively in less than a month are ""rare,"" but the question of whether there was cheating can be determined not by statistics but by an audit of the lottery system, according to a mathematician of the state university.       Guido David, who became known in the Philippines for his work with OCTA Research during the pandemic, weighed in on Friday, January 26, on the  PCSO lotto controversy .       In an interview with DWPM Radyo 630, David, a professor at the UP Institute of Mathematics, said the chances of winning in the 6/42 is one in 5 million; one in 14 million in 6/49; and one in 29 million in 6/55.       When asked on the chances of the lotto games being won successively in less than a month, like what happened in PCSO's ""Handog Pakabog"" promo draws, David replied:        ""Nagbigay ako ng scenario na a few hundred thousand ang pumupusta kada bola. So, every bola, ang probability na may tatama is nasa 2% or less than 2%. Pero pag sunod-sunod yan, kunyari, dalawang bola, it's 2% x 2% so 0.04%, so, paliit ng paliit. Kunyari, sampung sunod-sunod, napakaliiit ng probability nun. Hindi imposible, napakaliit. It's a rare occurence pero maliit yung probability.""       (I assumed a scenario of a few hundred thousand betting in every draw. So, every draw, the probability of winning is 2% or less than 2%. But if it's in succession, for example, if two draws, it's 2% times 2% so 0.04%, so, it gets smaller and smaller. For example, ten in succession, the probability of that is very small. It's not impossible, but very small. It's a rare occurrence but the probability is small.)       He also qualified that the chances of the lotto game being won depends on how many people bet. For instance, in the 6/42, there's a higher chance that someone will win if 5 million people bet than if only a few people bet.                                                None of big winners in PCSO's Christmas, New Year lotto games bet on all combinations, says GM                                                                                         When asked whether he agreed with Senator Koko Pimentel's observation that it was an ""anomaly,"" David said what happened in PCSO's recent promo draws ""raises eybrows"" due to its rarity but that ""statistics will never prove"" that there was cheating.        ""So kailangan i-audit, if ever, they should look at the process. Were the draws fair?...Kung gusto nilang iinvestigate, I guess, may statistical basis, kunyari medyo rare na occurrence,""  he added.  ""Yung pag audit, dun nila malalaman, hindi sa numbers .:       (So, there's a need for an audit, if ever, they should look at the process. Were the draws fair?...If they want to investigate, I guess, there's statistical basis [for it], for example, the occurrence here is rare. They'll find out in the audit, not in the numbers.)      David agreed with PCSO General Manager Mel Robles that PCSO's lottery is a ""game of chance.""       David teaches numerical analysis, game theory, mathematical biology, and machine learning in UP Diliman. He is member of OCTA Research and of the academic group Mathematical Finance and Acturial Science.       During the COVID-19 pandemic, Guido provided daily analyses of the country's positivity rate, testing statistics, and other important pandemic-related data.       In the Senate Games and Amusement hearing last Thursday, January 25, committee chair Raffy Tulfo asked the Department of Information and Communications Technology's Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (DICT-CICC) to look into the PCSO controversy.       Drexx Laggui, a technical consultant of the DICT-CICC, said they will have to check the PCSO's system, such as how it creates logs, and other processes.       He said the DICT-CICC can also look into PCSO's ISO documents and also compare the PCSO's system with the gaming rules in Nevada, USA. PCSO officials said its lotto system is ISO-certified.       ""We can employ digital forensics,"" Laggui said.                    Play  Video                     In a press release last January 19, the PCSO said it ""churned out multi-millionaires one after the other to the delight of millions of Filipino bettors,"" after the PCSO board augmented the jackpot draws for its ""Handog Pakabog"" Christmas and New Year draws.       The PCSO raised on December 16, 2023 the minimum guaranteed jackpot for the Grand Lotto 6/55, Ultra Lotto 6/58, Super Lotto 6/49 by P500 million each, and P100 million each for Lotto 6/42 and MegaLotto 6/45 as part of its Christmas and New Year draws.      On December 29, 2023, a lone bettor won P571 million in the Ultra Lotto 6/58, the biggest jackpot in 2023.      On January 16, 2024, a bettor won P640 million with the combination 26-33-14-48-06-42 in the Super Lotto 6/49 draw.      On January 17, another lone bettor won P698 million in the Grand Lotto 6/55 with the correct combination of 24-50-52-09-51-03 through PCSO's new e-Lotto platform.      Three bettors, meantime, won in the Lotto 6/42 jackpot on January 2 with a prize of P108 million.       Two people split the Megalotto 6/45 jackpot of P121 million on January 8.      Pimentel said during the Senate hearing that based on the history of PCSO's lotto draws, it usually took months before lotto games with a jackpot prize of P500 million or more were won, but in this recent series of draws, which he described as an ""anomaly,"" all the games with big prizes produced winners in less than month.        ""In less than one month, limang laro ang tinamaan...itong nangyari ng December is really an anomaly. Hindi lang one [lotto] game, limang games,""  he said. (In less than one month, 5 games were won...what happened this December is really an anomaly.)      Robles, however, told the committee that no cheating is being done.

2024-01-28 09:42:12,LOOK: How hard discount grocery DALI wins over value shoppers,"  MANILA, Philippines - If you're out shopping on a tight budget, check out DALI, the hard discount grocery popping up in neighborhoods around the country.      DALI hails from Switzerland - a place better known for its expensive watches and pricey chocolate - but this low-cost grocery is anything but. In its own words, the company brings ""good quality products at the lowest possible prices next door.""         BABANGON?  Kopi Juan, one of DALI's many private labels, may remind you of another popular coffee brand. Photo by Lance Spencer Yu/Rappler.       The key to DALI's success is its stripped-down business model. Rather than replicate a usual supermarket's aisle upon aisle of displays, DALI only sells a limited number of products, or what it calls ""core range item.""      These include everyday household products - snacks, kitchen staples, and cleaning supplies. While DALI carries some popular branded products, much of what it sells fall under its proprietary brands.      Tiptoeing the line of copyright infringement, these private labels might remind you of household favorites.                        ""DALI private label product quality meets or exceeds the equivalent national brands sold in other national retail chains,"" the company states in its website.      ""We focus on providing the same quality like the leading brand that we intend to replace but with significantly lower cost as the supplier does not need to spend on marketing, promotions, research etc.""      But how does DALI keep prices so low? As a ""hard discount"" grocery, the company cuts as many costs as it can - no frills, no extra service, no advertisements.      Stores - usually located in rural areas and urban areas just beyond business districts - are leanly staffed, often with just two cashiers and no baggers. That cuts out the cost of bags and the baggers. Items on shelves are in ""display ready cases"" - the cardboard boxes in which they were transported. That eliminates the extra cost of unpacking items and stocking them one by one on the shelves.         ITO ANG TAMA.  DALI also has its own ‘extra strong beer' that pays homage to a local favorite. Photo by Lance Spencer Yu/Rappler.       The hard discount grocery model could make DALI thrive in the Philippines, where food inflation has  forced consumers  to bump up their budgets or look for cheaper goods.       However, DALI could be up for a daunting task if it wants to compete in what the Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls an ""oligopolistic retail market structure,"" given that the three largest retail conglomerates in the Philippines already  controls 51%  of modern retail revenue and 38% of total food retail.      Still, the new kid on the block seems to be doing well. By the end of 2022, DALI had more than 250 retail stores in the Philippines. Its success has even caught the eye of the ADB. In early 2023, the international lender announced that it would acquire $15 million worth of common equity shares in HDPM Sin Pte. Ltd, marking the ADB's first investment into a hard discount retail company and its first agribusiness equity investment in the Philippines.      ""ADB's support for DALI's expansion will contribute to food security and food safety by ensuring essential products are available to consumers at affordable prices, in a hygienic environment, and by integrating local agricultural suppliers into the company's supply chains,"" said ADB director general for private sector operations Suzanne Gaboury back in 2023.      The $15-million infusion will finance the growth of DALI's store network, distribution centers, and cold chain infrastructure, along with funding its working capital requirements.       The ADB expects the expansion to create at least 4,300 new jobs, with nearly half of them for women. DALI is also expected to install off-grid rooftop solar panels in 200 of their stores and 5 of their distribution centers by 2026.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/how-hard-discount-grocery-dali-wins-over-value-shoppers/,Positive,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-26 14:08:10,[In This Economy] Stop using the PH economy as excuse for charter change,"  We keep hearing in the news that charter change is meant to improve or boost the Philippine economy.      But is that even true? Let's do a series of quick fact checks.       1) Did the 1987 Constitution stop progress?       Remember the revolting one-minute  ""EDSA-pwera"" ad  that ran on January 9, 2024? It claimed that because of the 1987 Constitution, progress stopped, the education system deteriorated, farmers were excluded, monopolies thrived, and inequality increased.      Basically, all ills of our society were blamed on the 1987 Constitution.      But I hope enough people remember or realize that the 1987 Constitution was precisely a reaction to the economic crisis and deterioration that happened during the Marcos dictatorship (1972-1986).      In my book   False Nostalgia  , I explained at length that the Philippine economy experienced its worst post-war recession in 1984 and 1985. Not only did progress stop, our economy even shrank!      More than half of Filipino families were poor. Meanwhile, the rich became richer, and the monopolies controlled by the Marcoses and their cronies also thrived.      Sure, growth was shaky after the 1986 People Power Revolution. But that was largely because of the political instability during the transition (recall the various coup d'etats) as well as the power crisis and natural disasters in the early 1990s.      Decades since then, it's undeniable the economy grew under the 1987 Constitution. In fact, economic growth accelerated in recent decades. In 2022, the national income (adjusted for inflation) was 4.64 times its level in 1986. Meanwhile, the average Filipino's income was 2.24 times higher in 2022 than in 1986.       Of course, it's valid to say we could have grown faster. But the Marcos dictatorship pulled down our growth trajectory so much.  Data show  that if we had not experienced a severe economic crisis in the early to mid-1980s, we could be a lot more prosperous now.      Once a leader in ASEAN, the Philippines sorely lagged behind many of our regional peers. Vietnam surpassed our national income in 2020, and Lao PDR is not far behind.      In sum, the 1987 Constitution was a poor, if imperfect, attempt to fix the broken economy and society left behind by the Marcos dictatorship. The economy was way worse before EDSA than after it.       2) Is the 1987 Constitution not written for a globalized world?       In a rare and recent  interview  with GMA News' Pia Arcangel on January 23, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. sat down to talk about many issues.      One thing that stood out was Marcos' statement that he's now willing to give charter change a chance.      He said: ""The 1987 Constitution was not written for a globalized world.... We have to adjust so that we can increase the economic activity in the Philippines, we can attract more foreign investors."" Recently, the new finance secretary, Ralph Recto,  echoed  the same view.      (Interestingly, just a year earlier, Marcos said things like: ""For me, all these things being talked about, we can do without changing the Constitution."")      There are two reasons why it feels inappropriate to invoke globalization as a reason for charter change.      First, if you look at the graph below, coming from the International Monetary Fund, the biggest increase in globalization happened from 1980 until 2008. Since the global financial crisis, we've been in an era of ""slowbalization"": a distinct slowdown of trade and capital flows across the world.      In a way, then, the Philippines missed the almost three-decade wave of globalization since the 1980s. Partially because we were hampered by a severe debt crisis and economic downturn brought about by the Marcos dictatorship, partially because of the 1987 Constitution's restrictions, and partially because of the economic and political uncertainties post-EDSA.      My colleagues at the UP School of Economics, for instance, have  long lamented  that we missed the wave of Japanese direct investments in the 1980s and 1990s.             Fast forward to 2024, our Constitution is  as liberalized as ever . Even former finance secretary Benjamin Diokno  admitted  in April 2023 that, ""I think we have already opened up our economy.""      As early as the 1990s, we liberalized the financial sector. Former president Rodrigo Duterte also signed one law after another liberalizing trade and investments.      Yet investments are just trickling in, not inundating our country.      Why? As I said in my  column  last week, ""foreign investors are looking at way more things than just the foreign participation rules."" There are other important barriers than what proponents of charter change are letting on.      This is not to say, of course, that it's futile to try to attract investments now. We can still liberalize investments by relaxing the remaining restrictions in the 1987 Constitution.      But let's be honest. What else is there to liberalize? I think even politicians are hard put to cite sectors that need liberalizing at this point.      The only remaining constitutional barriers to full foreign ownership are education, media, land, and natural resources. I don't think any politician will want to let go of land and natural resources. At any rate, there are workarounds such as long-term leases, joint ventures, and service contracts.      As for education and media, the idea was to ensure that Filipinos won't be too influenced by foreign ideas and opinions. Now  this  sounds totally anachronistic, given the internet age and social media. Also, can we really expect a tsunami of investments in education and media to come in and save our supposedly ailing economy? I think that's a stretch.       3) Will charter change boost growth and reduce unemployment?       Finally, lawmakers are painting charter change as a magic bullet for various aspects of our economy.      House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the President's cousin,  said  on January 22 that the 1987 Constitution's economic provisions serve as ""barriers that restrict potential growth."" He also said we need to open the economy so that foreign investments can come in to create new businesses, jobs, and livelihood for Filipinos.      Last year, Romualdez similarly  said  that constitutional change ""would further stimulate economic activities, create job opportunities, reduce poverty, and lower prices of goods and services.""      Meanwhile, other House leaders are saying that charter change can even  lower unemployment .      Statements such as these betray that some lawmakers are not keeping up with the latest statistics.      Data show that economic growth slowed down in 2023 largely because of the slowdown of consumption spending. This is possibly linked to the acceleration of prices since 2022, as well as the interest rate hikes of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas designed to combat inflation.      Now that inflation has gone down, maybe we can expect stronger economic growth in coming years. Resorting to charter change just to boost growth is like using a sledgehammer to crack open  butong pakwan .      Also, for the information of lawmakers, the unemployment rate in November 2023 was already at  3.6% , an 18-year low. Did we need charter change to achieve that? No. (Although we can still do a lot to reduce the  under employment rate, arguably the bigger problem.)      Funnily, Surigao del Norte 2 nd  District Representative Ace Barbers said that the lower unemployment rate should serve as an "" impetus "" for charter change. Huh?      All in all, beware of politicians using the Philippine economy (and spewing economic concepts) as an excuse to push for charter change. More likely than not, they do not know what they're talking about. -  Rappler.com         JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of  False Nostalgia: The Marcos ""Golden Age"" Myths and How to Debunk Them .

2024-01-26 13:12:19,Coins.ph goes global with crypto option for remittances,"  MANILA, Philippines - In 2024, local cryptocurrency exchange Coins.ph has big plans to expand to five continents - and crypto remittances by overseas Filipinos is fueling that growth.      ""My goal has always been, from day one, in Coins is basically, we're going to take what we build here, and we're going to want to bring that back to not just Filipino users here in the Philippines, but potentially Filipino users outside of the Philippines,"" said Wei Zhou, chief executive officer of Coins.ph and former chief finance officer of rival cryptocurrency exchange Binance.      ""With some of our innovations that we're building here, we want to take Coins.ph global, and be one of the first Filipino companies that have a real global footprint - servicing, not just Filipinos, but other people across the world,"" he added.      Currently, Coins.ph has already obtained licenses to operate in Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. Coins.ph country manager Jen Bilango told Rappler that the company will be operating in three out of five continents by the end of the first half of 2024 and in all five before the end of the year.      This expansion means that the app will be accessible and downloadable in countries outside of the Philippines. Aside from local communities in other countries using the app for retail trade, Coins.ph is eyeing another big target market - overseas Filipinos sending remittances.      ""With remittances being a vital contributor to the economy, we've made strategic partnerships that can provide better solutions for sending and receiving money abroad,"" Bilango said during a roundtable on Thursday, January 25.      For instance, an overseas Filipino in another country may convert their earnings into a  stablecoin  - a non-volatile cryptocurrency whose value is usually pegged 1:1 to the US dollar - which can then be sent to a crypto wallet in the Philippines.      Because crypto transactions happen quickly, cheaply, and digitally, crypto could be key for Filipinos to avoid longer wait times and high fees in traditional financial institutions like banks and ""pera padala"" centers.      Until Coins.ph is officially launched in their country of work, overseas Filipinos looking to use it for remittances should download and install the app first in the Philippines, as the app will not be downloadable in other areas. However, once installed, Filipinos can use the app for transactions even outside the Philippines.      The company is also eyeing other countries to expand to, such as the Middle East, which has millions of overseas Filipino workers that remit back billions of pesos every year.      However, to tap big overseas Filipino markets in the United States and other nearby Asian countries, the Philippine-based cryptocurrency exchange may turn to partnerships rather than holding a direct license.      ""Getting licenses in the US costs millions of dollars. The same is true of Japan, Korea, Hong Kong,"" said the company's CEO. ""In those regions, we hope to be able to build partnerships. We hope to be able to leverage off of their licenses and their partnerships in those regions to provide our services.""       No Binance? Opportunities await       Binance, the largest crypto trading platform in the world, has been  blocked  in the Philippines by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which points out that the company is not authorized to sell or offer securities here. The order also came after Binance's CEO  pleaded guilty  to breaking anti-money laundering laws in the US.      Filipinos using Binance still have some time to close their positions and bring out their investments. But if you ask Coins.ph's Zhou, the shutdown of his former company's operations in the Philippines presents opportunities.      ""We will have more opportunities. We will be able to onboard users onto our platform,"" he said. ""But I think it also creates challenges...for the existing users that may have been trading on the offshore exchanges.""      The home-grown cryptocurrency exchange plans to pull in those Binance users with zero trade fees to make the transition ""seamless."" Coins.ph is also attempting to ramp up their product offering to match the range of sophisticated financial products that offshore - but unregulated - crypto exchanges like Binance have.      Zhou said that they want to achieve as much product parity with offshore exchanges by ""maybe 2025,"" pointing out that as a regulated exchange, Coins.ph has to obtain approval for each type of product.       Coins.ph is regulated by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BPS) and the SEC. It holds licenses as an electronic money issuer and as a virtual asset service provider, which is the license that the BSP requires for crypto-based companies.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/coins-ph-goes-global-crypto-overseas-remittances/,Positive,['stocks' 'loans' '']
2024-01-25 20:10:11,Trump opens up lead over Biden in rematch many Americans don't want,"  WASHINGTON, DC, USA -  Donald Trump  leads  Democratic President Joe Biden  by six percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll that showed Americans are unhappy about an election rematch that came into sharper focus this week.      The nationwide poll of 1,250 US adults showed Trump leading Biden 40% to 34% with the rest unsure or planning to vote for someone else or no one. The poll had a margin of error of three percentage points.      That represented a gain for Trump after a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted earlier this month showed him and Biden tied, though a nationwide survey does not capture the subtleties of the electoral college contest that will be decided this fall in just a handful of competitive states.      As Trump handily beat his sole remaining primary challenger, Nikki Haley in New Hampshire on Tuesday, some 67% of respondents polled Monday through Wednesday said they were ""tired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new."" Still, just 18% said they would not vote if Biden and Trump were their choice.      ""I hate to think that we're constantly navigating the lesser of two evils,"" said Kimberly Sofge, a 56-year-old project manager in Washington, DC, this week. ""I honestly feel that we can do better.""      The two candidates themselves seem ready for a rematch following Trump's back-to-back wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, with the White House regarding Trump as a beatable challenger, and Trump fuming because Haley did not immediately drop out of the Republican race.      Trump's six-point lead held even when respondents were given the option of voting for third-party candidates, including anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with Trump drawing 36% support, Biden 30% and Kennedy 8%.                                               For women backing Haley, a sigh of relief at not voting for Trump                                                                                         Slightly more than half of respondents said they were dissatisfied with the U.S. two-party system, with just one in four satisfied by it.      Whitney Tallarico, 33, a consultant interviewed in Washington, is among those considering an alternative.      ""The independents don't really have a voice. Polarizing characters usually take the front seat, and it's a little sad for our country,"" Tallarico said this week. Asked whether she would vote for Biden or Trump, she said, ""I'll probably go for a third party.""      Age issue      Overall, the poll gave numerous signs that voters are not happy with their choices.      Seventy percent of respondents – including about half of Democrats – agreed with a statement that Biden should not seek re-election. Fifty-six percent of people responding to the poll said Trump should not run, including about a third of Republicans.      Biden has been weighed down by the widespread view that at 81, already the oldest person ever to be US president, he is too old for the job.      Three-quarters of poll respondents agreed with a statement that Biden was too old to work in government, while half said the same about Trump, who at 77 would also be among the oldest U.S. leaders ever if returned to the White House. Just over half of Democrats saw Biden as too old while a third of Republicans viewed Trump that way.      Haley, 52, is trying to marshal dissatisfaction to turn around her well-financed but flagging campaign.      ""Most Americans do not want a rematch between Biden and Trump,"" she said on Tuesday after her loss to Trump in New Hampshire. ""The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.""      The new poll showed Trump with a towering nationwide lead over Haley – 64% to 19% – as they prepare for the Feb. 24 Republican nomination contest in South Carolina, which Haley led as governor 2011-2017.                                               Trump and Biden shift focus to general election rematch as Haley fights on                                                                                         Turnout could still be high in the November general election in part because voters from both parties are highly motivated to beat the other side.      Fifty-nine percent of respondents who said they planned to vote for Biden said they were motivated primarily by opposition to Trump, while Trump voters were more positive about their candidate and his policies, with just 39% describing their vote as one against Biden.      Anti-Trump sentiment helped Biden defeat Trump in the 2020 election, when a record-high share of eligible voters cast ballots.      Another factor that could weigh on Trump: 55% of Republicans in the poll said he should be convicted and sentenced to prison if he broke the law. Trump, who is currently facing four criminal prosecutions, has argued in court that he should be immune to prosecution for actions taken while he was president.      To be sure, most Republicans do not think he is guilty – only one in five Republican respondents said it was believable that Trump solicited election fraud, one of the key charges against him, and four out of five said his political opponents were abusing the legal system to derail his presidential bid. - Rappler.com  ",https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/americans-dismayed-biden-trump-2024-rematch-survey-finds/,Negative,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-25 17:49:52,[OPINION] Jailing Jinggoy,"  For the crimes for which she has been convicted that involve such powerful individuals as senators and congressmen, including cabinet-rank presidential advisers who sit in the same table Ferdinand R. Marcos presides over,  Janet Lim-Napoles will most likely spend the rest of her life in jail . While the charges against her involve several from attempted bribery, to bribery, all the way to plunder, and whether she serves her individual sentences concurrently or consecutively, or whether time-served in detention discounts from the total, relative to the powerful involved in her crimes, the chances that they join her are slim to none.      Perhaps it is because she has been identified to be the criminal mastermind behind the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam while the politicians with their individual pork barrels have lesser roles and indirect accountabilities. Or perhaps, on a case-to-case basis, their individual amounts are smaller, the evidence better hidden, and their political clout, far above the laws they've written for the rest of us not entitled to be called ""honorable.""      The wheels of justice grind excruciatingly slow and for the powerful, they grind even slower. If at all. From the legitimate to the absurd, from the rational to the speculative, and indeed, from the legal to the political, the unfathomable reasons that Napoles' co-conspirators remain scot-free are legion.      Never mind rationality. And never mind absurdity. In our exceedingly charged political milieu, the vast difference between the legal and political is perhaps the most potent factor that differentiates and determines how justice is meted out.      The  recent conviction of Jose Pimentel Ejercito Jr. (aka Jinggoy Estrada)  for bribery and attempted bribery is a case in point. That the decision by a division of the Sandiganbayan did not cover plunder is a matter of amounts and not a question of criminal acts committed by the convicted. It is especially applicable where the crime is complex and involves several parties, both private individuals and public officials. In other words, the non-plunder conviction was not because of the convict's innocence but because of an arithmetic threshold applicable to those holding a public office.      The peso amount is important. Later we will realize its impact in determining the time Estrada might eventually serve behind bars, or if he will even be jailed at all.                       Must Read                          [#Shocking] Jinggoy, convicted sa bribery pero hindi sa plunder. Puwede ba ‘yon?                                                                                         While substantial deposits were nevertheless discovered in bank accounts identified to be Estrada's, and while these were concurrently transacted with the timing of pork barrel releases and subsequent deposits to accounts identified to be Napoles', the minimum amount needed for a conviction of plunder eventually fell short of P50 million (see G.R. No. 220598. April 18, 2017).      Never mind that initially, these accumulated beyond the threshold level differentiating plunder. After fine tuning, the P50-million threshold automatically took plunder off the table as much as it took reclusion perpetua off the menu of punitive options since the latter is the maximum applied to plunder.      While Estrada now stands convicted and the question of bail granted by the Sandiganbayan is no longer applicable, he still has the Supreme Court (SC) to which he can appeal for a reconsideration. Since the SC option remains as a venue that could reverse the Sandiganbayan's conviction, it is arguable that Estrada likewise remains innocent pending the complete exhaustion of his legal options until finally being proven guilty by the final arbiter in the judicial hierarchy.      The speedy application of justice has long been an issue with our justice system. That cases can fester, die, or descend into irrelevance and mootness within a court remains a curse. Dockets are full, procedural dilatory tactics abound, and always there seem to be more venues for respondents than there might be for appellants.      And then there is the unseen political hand. It makes sense that upon his conviction, Estrada himself denied that politics had any influence on the Sandiganbayan decision. He is probably right.      On the question of speedy justice, it also makes sense that among the lower courts, a division of the Sandiganbayan need not to seek en banc deliberations for a case to be raised to the SC. This affords the judicial system at least two upsides.      One, it removes an incremental venue for repetitive or redundant processes among peers who might be relatively unfamiliar with the minutiae of cases. Two, it insulates and protects the other divisions from any negativity from decisions taken by others within the court. This ensures that the Sandiganbayan as a whole remains essentially, or substantially, credible. As a whole, we believe it is.      A couple of inevitable non-political logistical realities likewise work in Estrada's favor. These also serve to keep him from being locked up.      The SC dockets are clogged and full and it is not unusual that any case elevated to them would take time before any finality is achieved.                        Must Read                          [OPINION] Court trial vacancies and presidential appointments                                                                                         The characteristic of the charges at the Sandiganbayan where plunder was avoided while the acts involving the PDAF were nevertheless considered brings into the arithmetic that determines total jail time the period served by Estrada while in detention. In other words, the ""time served"" discount may reasonably be applied to reduce the total jail time should he suffer a final conviction at the SC.      Estrada is a senior citizen. Do the math. Consider the average time the SC takes prior to a decision. Consider also that at the SC, decisions at the division level are subjected to the en banc. Finally, add to the timeline a period to consider motions for reconsideration. Within this normal process, Estrada's detention ""time served"" discount may apply and by the time the balance comes due, Estrada might well be within the temporal Goldilocks zone where ""compassion"" is applied to senior citizens.

2024-01-25 14:50:51,[Edgewise] Xi Jinping wants his 'diplomatic iron army' to win people's hearts,"  How dare a China foreign ministry deputy insult President Bongbong,  telling him to ""read more books?""        Oy, Deputy Mao Ning, only we the sovereign Filipino people can insult our presidents, granted most of them have been eminently deserving. You have no right. Our presidents may bungle, but they're  our  bunglers.       And, Deputy Mao Ning, since I'm not the Philippines' head of state or the ambassador to China, I can insult your Great, Glorious, and Correct Leader back without sparking a diplomatic brouhaha like you did.       Here it goes: perhaps General Secretary Xi Jinping should review the history of the Communist Party of China. If you denounce me, Deputy Mao Ning, I will double down: General Secretary Xi Jinping should review the CPC's history twice.       ""Chairman of Everything"" Xi should be reminded that the late Deng Xiaoping, whose strategy yielded the economic weight he's now haughtily throwing around, promised that his nation would never seek to bully others.       ""If one day, China should change color and turn into a superpower,"" Deng said, ""if it should play the tyrant in the world, subject others to its bullying, aggression, and exploitation, the people of the world should identify it as social-imperialism, expose it, oppose it, overthrow it together ( Special Session of the UN General Assembly, April 10, 1974 ).       Ouch! So, repurposing Mao Zedong's famed Cultural Revolution big character poster attack on the then-unloved ""capitalist roader"" Deng Xiaoping ( Peking Review , No. 33, 11-3-1967), I hereby say, ""Bombard the headquarters of the social imperialist Xi Jinping clique!""       Gone is China's ""friendship first, competition second"" ping-pong diplomacy of the Deng era, when it courted international sympathy and investments. Now, head swollen with superpower hubris, China has replaced goodwill with the combative ""Wolf Warrior Diplomacy,"" which paints every external criticism as a component of imperialist containment.        Filipinos have been enduring Wolf Warrior aggression, bullying, deviousness, and gaslighting in the West Philippine Sea with China imposing its way or the highway; and things will get worse. Beijing is quick to take offense at perceived slights from other governments and is as quick on the trigger with abrasive pushbacks, including punitive trade reprisals.                        Must Read                          Marcos defends tweet that angered China, says PH not endorsing Taiwan independence                                                                                         It banned Australian wine, beef, and barley after that country's prime minister called for an international probe of COVID's source; ditto for Canadian canola oil and meats after the arrest in Vancouver of a Huawei heiress-executive on violation of an embargo against Iran; same for Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Prize was awarded to imprisoned human rights activist Liu Xiaobo; similar actions against other trading partners that have displeased Beijing for one reason or another.      Expect more of the same swagger because Xi has just ordered his foreign affairs officials to ""create a  diplomatic iron army  that is loyal to the Party…dares to struggle...(and) observes strict discipline.""       But, he also wants his envoys to ""make deep friendships...fight to win people's hearts...create a trustworthy, lovable, and respectable image of China."" Diplomatic-iron-lovable-army. There must be a growing market for oxymorons in Xi's China.       For Filipinos, that only spells more coercion and indignities in the West Philippine Sea, most likely involving Chinese Coast Guard water-cannon salvos at Filipino fishing boats and naval vessels, with ""Have a nice day!"" greetings blaring from loudspeakers.       Despite Beijing's imperiousness, however, the world's second biggest economy is starting to look like a paper tiger. It's stalling - with a disastrous real estate meltdown, deflation, sky-high debt, high youth joblessness, plunging birth rates, timid consumer spending, and stock market  losses amounting to $7 trillion  since 2021.       Putting the brakes on Deng's pragmatic legacy, the Xi regime has mismanaged the economy, rashly favoring the state sector at the expense of private enterprises, hence scaring off foreign investments, neglecting the social safety net, imposing extreme zero-COVID lockdowns, and relying on ideological propellant to coax economic mileage.                        From Our Archives                          Xi Jinping a game-changer in Beijing's South China Sea shift                                                                                          Combine material decline with toughening state restrictions on personal freedoms, and no wonder thousands of Chinese citizens are voting with their feet. Last year,  US border authorities  apprehended more than  31,000  Chinese citizens entering illegally from Mexico, up from  1,500 annual average  over the last ten years.      Xi's answer to domestic setbacks is to stir up more ideological zeal, including enacting a new Patriotic Education Law, disseminating ""Xi Jinping Thought"" throughout civil society, exhorting citizens to ""seek hardship"" and sacrifice in the ""spirit of struggle,"" and a Mao-style cult of personality idolizing ""Grandpa Xi"" or ""Uncle Xi"" as the generational case may be.      Just as Mao Zedong instigated the Cultural Revolution to cover up the disastrous failure of his Great Leap Forward, the neo-Maoist Xi is whipping up big power nationalism to mask what already may be shaping up as a Great Leap Backward.       His call for more iron to stiffen the spine of his already pugnacious diplomatic army is vital to that scheme. Filipinos can only  expect even more insulting hardball from Beijing over the West Philippine Sea.        Have a nice day to you, too, Comrade Deputy Mao Ning.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-xi-jinping-wants-diplomatic-iron-army-win-people-hearts/,Positive,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-25 13:52:10,Dreaming big with you: Chat for change,"  Last Sunday, my husband, daughter and I had breakfast in our favorite Sunday market in Quezon City. It was our first time in a long time. As I sat with my toddler on one of the wooden picnic tables, sipping a cappuccino and mixing garlic flakes into our scalding bowl of  lugaw , I reveled in the sounds and smells, the hubbub, the wafting through of a dozen conversations happening all around us.      There is something magical in public spaces that draws people together. On that Sunday, the people in that market, including my family, gathered in the same spot because of our shared love for good food and common need to restock our pantries.      Once upon a time, social media exuded that same enchantment and optimism. Finally, a shared space overcoming distance and time for citizens to talk about issues they care about. But profit-driven algorithms, abuses by bad actors, and lack of responsible regulation turned these social media platforms into toxic spaces.       So we retreated to our closed messaging groups. They're safe because we know the people there - our friends, family, bicycle club mates, fellow vintage furniture lovers, etcetera.      But they are also insular and limited in reach. They are our comfort zones and echo chambers.      I want to invite you to a hybrid space - the community chat rooms on our app,  Rappler Communities .      For two weeks, I've been leading something we call community chats on the app. They are live, time-bound chat sessions about specific topics of public interest. Our first community chat was about the rich tradition of  Traslacion  on January 9.       Our faith reporter Paterno Esmaquel II, along with our other staff who covered the hours-long religious event, went on the #faith chat room to give updates about the procession. Jayeel Cornelio, an Ateneo professor and sociologist of religion, chimed in with compelling insights about what it means to be a Nazareno devotee.       We also recently had a community chat about the  new Samsung smartphone , the first to prominently feature artificial intelligence, led by our technology editor Gelo Gonzales as he covered the launch in California. Two fellow tech lovers, Isa does Tech, a content creator, and Gadget Pilipinas' Gian Viterbo joined the chat.      When p-pop group  VXON  performed in our newsroom, their fans, Vixeys, got on the #pop-culture chat room to send their questions that were then read out during the interview portion. Our resident p-pop expert Russell Ku sent behind-the-scenes photos of the VXON boys to the chat room, to the delight of the fans.      Not a p-pop fan but a p-pol geek? There were some interesting community chats in the #philippine-politics chat room too! Our political reporters and editors got a chat going about the appointment of  Ralph Recto  as Marcos' new finance secretary while the President was holding a press conference about it.       Last Monday, there was an interesting discussion about who the opposition should field for senator in the 2025 elections. You can still check out the names mentioned there by  backreading  the conversation.      It would take several newsletters to recount all of the community chats we've held so far. I invite you to download our app and see for yourself! There's a chat room for different kinds of public interest issues - #climate-change, #liveable-cities, #overseas-filipinos, #health-and-wellness, #money, #sports, #factsfirstPH, #crime, #justice-and-human-rights. There will be a private invite-only chat room for Rappler+ members to update them on exclusive events and content. If this sounds interesting to you,  here's  how you can get Rappler+ membership.

They will soon be identifiable by a green shield icon, which Rappler journalists also have beside their names.       What makes Rappler community chat rooms different from the group chats you're already part of?         The content is not determined by profit-driven algorithms. Journalists are in charge. A newsbot is programmed to send articles relevant to the chat rooms but it does so based on topics that thematically fall under the chat room's focus.      Journalists are present in all the chat rooms. Your insights and takes matter to us and this is a way we can meaningfully and immediately engage with you.      It's open to the public. The app is free and can be downloaded by anyone. Chat rooms can be joined by anyone.       Community guidelines  banning hate speech, calls to violence and harm are enforced in all chat rooms. A bot has been programmed to automatically censor harmful messages. This can then be appealed to human moderators.       Anyone can start a conversation. And when you do, Rappler's journalists and the chat room community are listening.        There are currently around 200 to 300 members in every chat room. We hope to grow this community with you. We have many more exciting plans for the chat rooms. Could some serve as hotlines to report abuse or government negligence? Could they be a space for crowdsourcing story ideas and getting instant feedback about our reportage? Could they be a place for people to assess candidates in the upcoming 2025 elections? Could they be where book lovers converge with literary critics and bookstore owners?      At Rappler, we dream big, but always with you, our readers, in mind. Dream with us, and let these dreams turn to action, and hopefully, change.      You can download the app on  Google Play  or  App Store  and join whichever chat room piques your interest.

2024-01-24 21:15:46,"To raise gov't revenues, Recto says solution need not involve new taxes","  MANILA, Philippines - The Marcos administration is aiming to raise at least P4.3 trillion for 2024 to fund the national budget, all while avoiding the introduction of unpopular new taxes to rev up revenues.      New Finance Secretary Ralph Recto said the target, which is 11.9% higher than the projected collections made in 2023, is possible by improving how the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Bureau of Customs (BOC) collect taxes.      ""There are no plans of imposing additional new taxes. I think our first job is to collect what is on the table,"" Recto said in his first media briefing on Wednesday, January 24.      Recto went on to explain that imposing additional taxes could raise prices of goods amid an already high inflationary environment.      Recto's predecessor, Benjamin Diokno, earlier mulled higher taxes on junk food and sweetened beverages.      The Department of Finance has also proposed a revamp on motor vehicle road user's tax, but Recto said they are now ""tempering"" it.      ""Motorists pay a lot of taxes...there are excise taxes and VAT (value added tax) on oil, there are excise taxes, duties, and VAT on vehicles. Today, 50% or thereabouts of vehicles are unregistered. And if you impose higher taxes, maybe more vehicles will not register,"" Recto said.      In a nutshell, Recto is looking for ways to collect more from the current taxes imposed by the tax code.      President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. recently signed into law the  Ease of Paying Taxes Act , which aims to help taxpayers comply with the law. Part of the law is the digitalization of services, which is deemed to improve compliance.           IN PHOTOS: Finance Secretary  @ralphrecto  held a joint press conference with  @birgovph  Commissioner Romeo D. Lumagui, Jr. and  @CustomsPH  Commissioner Bienvenido Y.

It was only able to exceed its collection targets in 2020, when the government was forced to revise the goal downward due to the pandemic-induced recession.                ""I think the best way to raise revenues is to grow the economy and to expand the tax base,"" Recto said on Wednesday.       From January to November 2023, the BIR collected a total of P1.85 trillion. It needed to collect P78 billion last December to reach the full-year target of P2.63 trillion.      BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. recently initiated a nationwide tax compliance verification drive, an initiative that does not punish companies but encourages them to pay the right taxes.      ""We noticed a lot of violations, but we educated them. We did not impose any penalties...so we taught them...what their violations were,"" Lumagui said.      Lumagui also recently reshuffled hundreds of staff from different district offices, a move viewed to clean up the ranks of the BIR.      Meanwhile, Customs Commissioner Bienvenido Rubio has a tougher job as he needs to increase the BOC's collections by as much as 20% as they need to collect P1 trillion for 2024.       In 2023, they were able to collect P883 billion.      ""I do not assume [an] increase of volume and on the possible assumptions of an increase in the exchange rate of dollars. So, what we do is to increase our efficiency,"" Rubio said. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/raise-government-revenues-recto-says-not-involve-new-taxes/,Neutral,['insurance' 'retirement' 'stocks']
2024-01-24 15:09:32,Former Taiwan ally Nauru reestablishes diplomatic ties with China,"  BEIJING, China - China and Nauru re-established diplomatic ties on Wednesday, January 24, after the tiny Pacific island nation  unexpectedly severed relations  with its now former ally Taiwan in a move the United States described as ""unfortunate.""       The Pacific has become a source of intense competition for influence between Washington which has traditionally viewed it as its backyard, and Beijing, which has targeted Taiwanese diplomatic allies there.      During a ceremony in Beijing, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nauru counterpart Lionel Aingimea formally signed a document to restore bilateral relations, with ties at the ambassadorial level resuming with immediate effect.      According to the document Nauru recognizes that there is ""only one China in the world"" governed by the People's Republic of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.      Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claim and accused it of trying to pressure Taiwan immediately after its recent presidential election with news of Nauru's switch.      Severing ties with Taiwan was ""an independent political decision made by the Nauruan government,"" Wang told reporters after the signing ceremony.      ""We are willing to share with Nauru the development opportunities brought by Chinese-style modernization.""      Aingimea said his country looked forward to their new relationship.      ""It'll be built on strength, built on development strategy. It will have a synergy of policies. It will have good collaboration and shared governmental principles that both our countries enjoy,"" he said.      ""The prospect is bright.""      Democratically governed Taiwan lost Nauru, one of its few remaining diplomatic allies, to China on January 15, just two days after a new Taiwanese president was elected.      China claims Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taiwan strongly disputes.      Nauru's government said it was seeking full resumption of diplomatic relations with China ""in the best interests"" of the country and its people.      Nauru had recognised China before, between 2002 and 2005.      ‘Unfortunate'      The United States, which only recognizes China but is Taiwan's most important international backer, said last week that Nauru's decision was ""unfortunate"" and ""disappointing"", warning Beijing's promises often go unfulfilled.      Taiwan's 12 remaining diplomatic allies include the Vatican, Guatemala and Paraguay, plus Palau, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.      Wang said having diplomatic ties with Taiwan ran counter to those nation's own interests, infringes on China's sovereignty and ""should be corrected sooner or later"".      ""We urge these countries to recognise the trend of the times, seize historical opportunities, fulfill their obligations under international law, stand with the international community, and correctly align with history,"" he said.      Tuvalu expects to review its diplomatic ties with Taiwan after an election on Friday, Finance Minister Seve Paeniu told Reuters, adding voters wanted more financial support from the international community for climate change and development.      Taiwan's presidential office said president-elect Lai Ching-te, currently vice president, spoke on Wednesday with Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine and invited her to attend his inauguration on May 20.      ""For the people of Taiwan, President Heine's visit will be a symbol of the firm friendship between the two sides,"" it cited Lai as saying.      After Nauru said it was cutting ties with Taiwan, the Marshall Islands offered its firm support to Taipei.      Taiwan's presidential office said Heine assured Lai that relations are ""rock solid"" and she was grateful for Taiwan's development aid.      ""Truly Taiwan can help,"" it quoted her as saying.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/nauru-reestablishes-diplomatic-ties-with-china/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-24 10:57:20,"UST, Asia's oldest university, now has a Hong Kong alumni chapter","  SHEUNG WAN, Hong Kong - In a historic first, Thomasian professionals in Hong Kong collectively launched on Friday, January 19 the pioneering University of Santo Tomas (UST) Alumni Association Hong Kong Chapter (USTAAHK), joining more than a dozen other Thomasian alumni associations overseas in the 413-year history of the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Asia's oldest existing university.       The milestone inauguration comes just one month after the USTAAHK was both formally recognised as a registered society (Society registration number: 0065480)   by the Hong Kong government in December 2023, and a duly registered Philippine organisation with the Consulate General of the Philippines in Hong Kong the same month.       The USTAAHK is made up of 13 founding members, namely Jan Yumul, president of USTAAHK;  Nobel Gabasan, vice president; Anna Pendry, public relations officer; Mr. Erwin Regalado, secretary; Byron Agarano, treasurer; and Joel Almeda, auditor.       Pendry, Gabasan, Almeda, Agarano, and Regalado, also serve concurrent roles, as chairperson, Socio-Cultural Events Committee; vice chairperson, Socio-Cultural Events Committee; chairperson, Finance Committee; vice chairperson, Finance committee, and chairperson, Sports and Games committee, respectively.       Other founding committees include Tanya Sales Manzano, chairperson for external affairs, Communications and Marketing ; John Go, chairperson for internal affairs, Communications and Marketing; Joy Alba, chairperson, Membership and Presence; Maureen Pickering, vice chairperson, Membership and Presence; Jenely de Ocampo, chairperson, Advocacy; Michelle Rea Yongque, vice chairperson, Advocacy; and Victorino Baltazar, vice chairperson, Sports and Games.       While the UST alumni in Hong Kong have previously organised social, family-oriented, and team-building activities, this marks the first time the group has formalised their association where an induction ceremony was held at The Hive in Sheung Wan. The event was well supported with the attendees reaching more than 100 Thomasian alumni, business representatives, academic representatives, community leaders, and nonprofit organisations.       Thomasian core values      Newly designated Philippine Consul General to Hong Kong Germinia Aguilar-Usudan, a Juris Doctor (Doctor of Law) graduate from UST, graced the event as keynote speaker and administered USTAAHK's founding officers' oath.               In her speech, Aguilar-Usudan said the UST ""is not only the university where we pursued our education and earned our degrees"", but it was also ""the place that developed our character and who we are today"".       ""Its core values, namely 'competence, compassion and commitment, guide us in the pursuit of our dreams and aspirations,"" said Aguilar-Usudan.       ""As founding officers of the USTAAHK, you are expected to perform your task with competence, to serve everyone with compassion, and to fulfil your mandate with commitment. Let us all serve our kababayans in HK, 'the UST way' and make our alma mater proud,"" she added.       The Consul General also seized the opportunity to wish the attendees a belated New Year, and an advance Lunar New Year.       ""2024 is the year of the Wood Dragon. It is expected to be a great year to start new projects, explore new opportunities and create value for yourself and others. A very suitable year for the new USTAAHK. Congratulations!"" said Aguilar-Usudan.       ""I wish all of you good health, happiness, and a successful new year ahead. Maraming, maraming salamat po. Mabuhay! Mabuhay ang UST! Mabuhay, mabuhay ang USTAAHK. Maraming Salamat,"" she added.       The induction ceremony was also supported by guests who flew in from UST Manila, namely the UST Office of Alumni Relations (OAR), led by Ms. Joreen Rocamora, acting director of UST-OAR; Carla Romina, alumni engagement officer of UST-OAR; and Marlot Ira Coleen Ngo, web data management officer at UST-OAR.       Dr. Evelyn Songco, chairman of UST Alumni Association Inc. (USTAAI), also graced the event. In her opening remarks, she linked the latest addition of the USTAAHK to the USTAAI family to that of the birth of a child, which ""is always a joyful occasion"".       She said the birth of an alumni association ""is definitely a cause of joy"" and so ""we gather this evening to celebrate that"".       ""We also celebrate tonight the past and the future. We celebrate the past because every alumni group coming together is born out of the alumni's connection to the past; because of the memories of our alma mater,"" said Songco.       ""Today, we celebrate the future because I am sure that with this event tonight, you will always have meetings and say ""Kita tayo"". With those words comes the promise of the future - the promise of faith, of hope, and of charity,"" she added.       Songco also reminded the Hong Kong Thomasian community that the promise of faith ""rests on our fidelity to our alma mater and on one another as we promise to see each other in the future"", in continuing to ""pursue the mission of our profession or our life advocacy"", and that the promise of hope ""rests on how well we will serve our alma mater, the alumni, and the community"".       ""The promise of charity rests on how generous we shall be with our time, talent, and treasure to keep in touch with one another, conduct assemblies, and activities for the benefit of our alma mater and the Thomasian alumni in HK, and the community,"" said Songco.       She said faith, hope, and charity ""have amazingly sustained the USTAAI, the mother alumni association of all recognized alumni associations"" and that they were in constant partnership with the Thomasian Alumni Community Foundation, Inc (TACFI), which raises funds for the activities of the USTAAI.       ""Giving birth and sustaining an alumni association is a daunting task. It is a volunteer work for all of us. It is a commitment; a mission; and most importantly, it is an act of giving. As volunteers, we are blessed not with material things but with joy in our hearts. That is our reward,"" said Songco.       The USTAAI chairman was also accompanied by Katherine Lou Bundang, business manager, USTAAI, and Pickering, who serves concurrent positions with USTAAI and USTAAHK.       Dawn of new chapter      Bringing a message to the newly inducted USTAAHK Board of Directors on behalf of the Very Rev. Fr. Richard G. Ang, OP,PhD, Rocamora, acting director of UST-OAR, said the establishment of the USTAAHK was ""the dawn of a new chapter"".       ""My heartfelt congratulations to all of you! You have accepted the mantle of leadership with courage and dedication, stepping forward to serve our vibrant community of Hong Kong-based Thomasians. Your commitment to upholding the legacy of UST, fostering unity among alumni, and propelling our association to even greater heights is truly inspiring,"" said Rocamora.       She noted that the path ahead ""may be paved with challenges"", but with ""unwavering determination and a shared vision, you will conquer them all"".       ""Embrace the diversity of the association, draw strength from our shared history, and never lose sight of the values that bind us together: compassion, commitment and competence, said Rocamora.       ""Let your leadership be a beacon of light and inspiration for every Thomasian in Hong Kong. Remember, the success of UST Alumni Association Hong Kong lies not just in your individual efforts but in the collective spirit of our association,"" she added.       Chapter's advocacies      In her closing remarks, Hong Kong-raised Yumul, founding president of USTAAHK, acknowledged and thanked Songco and the USTAAI, the Manila-based mother chapter, for welcoming the USTAAHK as a member under its wings. She also thanked the UST-OAR for being instrumental in forming the USTAAHK's establishment.       Yumul also unveiled the chapter's advocacies, which would focus on uplifting and mainstreaming Filipino professionals in Hong Kong, supporting youth empowerment, and putting ""care"" in the healthcare of migrant domestic workers.       USTAAHK events will also aim to target the promotion of Philippine arts and culture in Hong Kong through hosting exhibits, live demonstrations, and workshops by Filipino artists, musical performances by UST groups.       ""Today is a celebration of countless overcoming and coming together. A lot of people ask me why the need to form the USTAAHK. (To) the Filipinos in Hong Kong, let's face the reality. We've been boxed into one profession for a very long time. So, I hope we can change this. I hope our engagements will deepen and broaden as we overcome challenges,"" said Yumul.       According to the Home Affairs Department's Race Relations Unit, citing the 2021 Population Consensus, there are 201,291 Filipinos in Hong Kong with more than half of the population employed as domestic workers in the city.       ""There were ‘Three Cs' of the Thomasian values that were mentioned tonight: competence, commitment, and compassion. In the Hong Kong version, I want to add one more ‘C'. (Be) 'Community Engagers' because we will go very far. The establishment of the association ends our 14-year journey in search of Thomasian trailblazers and organizers. We look forward to your support,"" she added.       Yumul also acknowledged several community leaders in the academic, NGO, and business fields for graciously accepting the association's invitation.       Some notable guests included Cynthia Abdon-Tellez, general manager of the Mission for Migrant Workers, Janet Carnay, volunteer at the Bethune House Migrant Women's Refuge, and Thiru Nachiappan, Chairman, Tomorrow's Youth Development Fund.       Jonnet Kudera, Regional Philanthropy Manager, The Fred Hollows Foundation, and Lito Castillo, Chairperson, Hong Kong Musicians' Union were also among those present.       The event was also attended by business executives such as Estephanie Chan, account executive at Philippine Airlines, as well as past chairmen of the Philippine Association of Hong Kong, namely Jocelyn S. Palomaria, Myrna P. Hill, and Kathy De Guzman, who is also general manager at PNB Hong Kong.       Members of the academic community who came to support the event included Dr. Theresa Cunanan, associate programme director, Division of Arts and Languages, College of International Education at Hong Kong Baptist University, and Jan Gube, Assistant Professor at the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, The Education University of Hong Kong.       Thomasian alumni Dr. Michael Manio, lecturer and head articulation programme at the University of Hong Kong Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences was also present.

2024-01-23 14:08:07,[OPINION] Senators won't Cha-Cha with Zubiri?,"  Since 1997, when the first attempt was made to revise the Constitution, the Senate has stood like an immovable slab of concrete blocking all initiatives by charter revisionists.       The stubborn defiance has earned for the Senate the admiration of public intellectuals who regard the Constitution as sacred text and sectors who discern the selfish designs behind charter change, or Cha-Cha.       Yet we have to concede that the senators' obstinacy has been driven mainly by self-preservation.       Emasculating the Senate seems to be a recurring obsession among members of the House, where most Cha-Cha efforts have started. Reducing the senators' six-year term of office has been a recurring resolution, intended, in the view of observers, to weaken the potency of the Senate's institutional independence and dampen their predisposition to act as gadflies to a sitting president.      But the Senate that has said ""no"" to Cha-Cha for decades and through several administrations is now willing to dance .        Zubiri's ballroom      Why did the Senate yield? According to Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri, this time the Senate will take the lead, or rather, has been asked by the President himself to take the lead, in amending the Constitution's economic provisions.       In Zubiri's ballroom, the once inflexible Senate will now show the House how to do the Cha-Cha. Not through People's Initiative, which the President, according to Zubiri, has described as divisive, but through a Constituent Assembly where both chambers will vote separately.                         Must Read                          Zubiri dances to Cha-Cha: Senate to lead Constitution review on economic provisions                                                                                         To underscore his earnest dedication to Cha-Cha, Zubiri initially said the hearings would be led by veteran Senator Sonny Angara, head of the finance committee, rather than the neophyte Robin Padilla, chair of the constitutional amendments committee whose knowledge of the Constitution is as deep as a puddle.        But after a caucus that lasted, according to media reports, for more than three hours, the senators decided to transfer the responsibility to Padilla without offering an explanation. The former action star, surly and predisposed to shaming resource persons smarter than him, will now be charged with presiding over committee hearings on allowing foreign ownership in educational institutions, public utilities, and the advertising industry. (READ: P adilla first non-lawyer to head Senate charter change panel since 1986 )      The scope of these amendments would call for the erudite inputs of constitution experts, business leaders, and economic thinkers. Smart people, in short.       Slap on the wrist      According to Zubiri, these three provisions were vetted by the President in a meeting with him and Speaker Martin Romualdez before the Speaker flew to Davos, Switzerland, as the President's representative to the annual elite smooch fest.       The turnaround in committee assignments, however, could be seen as a slap on the wrist from his fellow senators. Zubiri may have overstepped when he eagerly accepted the President's request without consulting the other senators, breaking the time-honored norm of collegiality.         But the trigger for the President's request, the supposedly divisive signature drive to amend the charter, has shown no signs of slowing down.       By this week the so-called people's initiative is expected to  garner the signatures  of 12% of voters nationwide, the threshold set by the Constitution. Albay Representative Joey Salceda sees ratification by July, in time for the President's State of the Nation Address.                        Must Read                          [OPINION] Can the people's initiative proponents pull off a miracle?                                                                                         Why the persistence? It's all about the numbers. The proposed amendment in the signature drive, that the two chambers vote as one instead of separately on charter amendments, gives the House the numerical advantage.       If the amendment is ratified, the House representatives can outvote the senators on any provision. They can expand the scope of the amendments to include other economic provisions. They can even introduce amendments to political provisions, such as term extensions for the President and themselves, and shorter terms for senators.       Malacanang could act shocked, wag its finger at the House, and then accept the amendments as an expression of democracy.       Of course, all of that is in the realm of conjecture. But stranger things have happened in politics in the last two years, as if we need reminding.      Slow death?      The signature campaign's timetable, however, can be derailed by a  legal challenge  before the Supreme Court. The High Court is entitled to change its mind, although Cha-Cha opponents are certain that it won't. But like I said, stranger things have happened.      That is where the Senate comes in. After all, three economic provisions are better than nothing. But with the smart-shaming Padilla helming the discussions, it would be tough attracting a half-decent roster of resource persons. The amendments could die from intellectual asphyxiation.      So is the Senate's consent a Plan B for charter change, or was it all a ruse to buy time for the signature drive and dampen the senators' opposition to charter amendments? The harder question: Was Zubiri set up? We hope not.       Regardless, the President seems poised to accomplish this year, July at the earliest, what no other post-EDSA president has done. He would have amended the Constitution with only token resistance from senators. And all he had to do was ask nicely.  - Rappler.com        Joey Salgado is a former journalist, and a government and political communications practitioner.

2024-01-22 16:45:03,Finance Secretary Ralph Recto completes Bangko Sentral's Monetary Board,"  MANILA, Philippines - Finance Secretary Ralph Recto took his oath of office as the government sector representative to the Monetary Board (MB), the powerful seven-member group that steers the country's monetary policy.      Recto took his oath on Monday, January 22, in a ceremony administered by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli Remolona Jr.      The finance secretary, whose appointment to the Cabinet was announced on January 11, is the latest and final addition to the board. Benjamin Diokno, a former BSP governor and the finance secretary before Recto, also joined the MB days earlier on Tuesday, January 16.      From left to right in the image below, the Monetary Board now includes:        Romeo Bernardo, sitting as a private sector representative      Anita Aquino, sitting as a private sector representative      Former finance secretary and BSP governor Benjamin Diokno, sitting as a private sector representative      BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr., sitting as chairperson      Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, sitting as the government sector representative      Bruce Tolentino, sitting as a private sector representative      Former treasurer of the Philippines Rosalia de Leon, sitting as a private sector representative          MONETARY BOARD. The seven members of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' Monetary Board stand side by side. Photo from Department of Finance       Before Monday's official announcement, BSP officials were  hesitant to confirm  that Recto would sit as the government sector representative on the MB. Although a finance secretary often takes the seat of the government representative on the board, officials pointed out this wasn't a hard rule. For instance, BSP officials said, secretaries from the Department of Trade and Industry and the National Economic and Development Authority have served as the board's government representative in the past.      ""For now, there's an appointed secretary of finance but me personally, I'm not sure if the secretary of finance will sit as a member of the Monetary Board because the provision says representative from the government,"" BSP Deputy Governor of the Corporate Services Sector Eduardo Bobier said during a media information session on Friday, January 19.      Recto's own appointment as finance secretary was preceded by months of rumors that Diokno was on his way out of the Cabinet. (READ:  LIST: Signs that Recto was replacing Diokno as finance chief )      Now, his current seat at the MB comes with the responsibility of helping steer the country's monetary policy and supervising its financial institutions. This includes raising, lowering, or maintaining its  key policy rate  in a bid to  limit inflation .      The position also comes with a fat purse. MB members are consistently among the highest-paid officials in the government every year. In 2022, the  list of top paid officials  was dominated by MB members, such as then-BSP governor Felipe Medalla (P34.172 million) and Diokno (P28.781 million), as well as Anita Aquino (P26.362 million), Bruce Tolentino (P25.679 million), Peter Favila (P24.389 million), and Antonio Abacan Jr. (P24.026 million).  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/finance-secretary-ralph-recto-completes-bangko-sentral-pilipinas-monetary-board/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-22 13:54:37,FACT CHECK: Zubiri not expelled from Senate,"   Claim:  Senate President Juan Miguel ""Migz"" Zubiri was expelled from office.      Rating: FALSE       Why we fact-checked this:  The false video was uploaded on January 20, 2024, by a YouTube channel with 111,000 subscribers. As of writing, it has been viewed over 23,000 times with 481 likes and 56 comments.       The video's thumbnail originally showed photos of Zubiri, Vice President Sara Duterte, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, and Senator Imee Marcos. It was altered to appear as if Senator Marcos was holding a supposed order expelling Zubiri from the Senate. An arrow points to the document along with the text, ""Confirmed. Good News"" and  ""Sibak na""  (Expelled). The thumbnail also displayed the text:  ""Tinanggal na si Zubiri. Sa wakas pinalitan sa pwesto""  (Zubiri was removed. Finally he was replaced.)      The video's title, which has since been revised, previously read: "" Viral video: Nasibak na. Zubiri sa wakas tinanggal sa pwesto. Nagulat si Tamba sa pasabog ni Sen. Imee""  (Viral video: Expelled. Zubiri was finally removed from his post. Tamba was shocked by the revelations of Sen. Imee.)              The bottom line:  Zubiri remains the Senate President, as seen on the Senate website's  roster of senators  of the 19th Congress.       The official Facebook accounts of  Zubiri ,  Marcos , and the  Senate  have not made any confirmation regarding the senator's alleged removal from office.      Moreover, there are no reports about any move in the Senate to expel Zubiri from office.  Article VI, Section 16, of the Constitution  explains the process for expelling a senator: ""Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds of all its Members, suspend or expel a Member. A penalty of suspension, when imposed, shall not exceed sixty days.""        What the video actually shows:  No evidence is provided in the misleading video to support its claim. Instead, it only shows a compilation of photos of Zubiri, Romualdez, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., with audio narration from the YouTube channel Badong Aratiles Vlog. The video's narrator talks about Zubiri's statement that he would  step down from his post  as Senate president if Congress introduces amendments other than the economic provisions of the 1987 Constitution.       Zubiri changes tune:  Known for being previously  against  charter change, Zubiri, after meeting with the President and Speaker Romualdez, said the Senate would now  take the lead  in reviewing proposals to amend the economic provisions of the Constitution, for eventual adoption by the House of Representatives. (READ:  [In This Economy] Will economic charter change work? An objective look at the studies )      On January 15, Zubiri filed  Resolution of Both Houses No. 6 , ""proposing amendments to certain economic provisions of the 1987 Constitution."" Co-authored by Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda and Senator Sonny Angara, the resolution only includes amendments to the operation of public utilities and education services.       The resolution needs  18 votes  in the Senate to be adopted.

2024-01-20 21:18:01,Why did the Philippines reactivate its military counterintelligence group? ,"  MANILA, Philippines - Some three decades ago, the Philippines' then commander-in-chief, the late Fidel V. Ramos, concluded that the military's counterintelligence unit was successful in the ""neutralization and prosecution of scalawags"" in its ranks.      So on October 16, 1995, Ramos ordered the creation of a ""Presidential Task Force on Intelligence and Counterintelligence Against Scalawags.""      The task force then had the power to ""conduct intelligence and counterintelligence operations to detect and identify active and former military and police personnel and their cohorts involved in criminal activities,"" according to Executive Order No. 280, issued in 1995 and signed by Ramos.      Ramos had also disbanded the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)' Counterintelligence Group, according to AFP spokesperson Colonel Francel Padilla.      Yet 34 years after it was first organized on December 29, 1989, 28 years after its replacement task force was created, and almost two decades after its revival under former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the AFP has again reinstated the Counterintelligence Group (CIG).      AFP chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. himself led the reactivation ceremony of the AFP-CIG in ceremonies held on January 18. The unit was officially reactivated on January 11.      It is headed by Colonel Jonathan Manio, under the supervision of AFP Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence Major General Ferdinand Barandon. Rappler has asked the AFP for general staffing details of the AFP-CIG and its structure, but has yet to receive a reply as of this posting      What will it be doing?      In a release to media, Padilla explained that the CIG was reactivated ""with the mission to conduct counterintelligence support nationwide in line with the AFP's mission.""      Padilla added, ""Upon its reactivation, AFPCIG's mission has been expanded from just counter-destabilization to performing counter-infiltration, counter-espionage, and counter-sabotage.""      The United States' Central Intelligence Agency, in a 1957 secret memorandum that's since been made public, defines counterintelligence as ""intelligence activity, with resultant information product, which is undertaken to protect the security of the nation, and its personnel and installations abroad, against espionage, counterespionage, sabotage as subversion.""      The note further reads, ""As an activity, counterintelligence is the process of procuring, developing, recording, and disseminating information concerning espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and subversion directed against the national security, and of penetrating, manipulating, or repressing individuals, groups, or organizations conducting or capable of conducting such acts.""        REACTIVATION. The Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines, General Romeo Brawner Jr. PA, hands over the Office Symbol to the Acting Commander of the AFP Counterintelligence Group (AFPCIG), Colonel Jonathan Manio PA, during the Reactivation Ceremony of the AFPCIG on January 18, 2024, in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City. Photo by Armed Forces of the Philippines       What did it do before?      Under the late president Cory Aquino, the AFPCIG worked on chasing after rebel soldiers who had resorted to crime in the aftermath of failed coup attempts, the office of now-Senator Win Gatchalian noted in a  release  during his time in the House of Representatives.      A member of the Lower House then, Gatchalian was calling for the creation of a counterintelligence task force for the police.      Under Ramos, the group was disbanded and a presidential task force was created to go after the same ""scalawags."" Its responsibilities concerned the illegal activities of soldiers and other uniformed personnel.      Then, in 2005 - according to a  book  by the Philippine Center of Excellence in Defense, Development and Security, the National Defense College of the Philippines, and the Security Reform Initiative Inc. - Arroyo revived the AFPCIG ""to monitor any allegation of destabilization plots and corruption inside the military"" after the uprising known as EDSA Tres.      Why was it reactivated?      Padilla, in an interview with state-run PTV's  Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon , said the AFP routinely recalibrates its makeup depending on its goals.       ""Our units will also adjust to the pressing situation...we marry the different units according to the threats we are facing,"" she explained.      ""[It was reactivated] based on the pronouncement that we will enhance our intelligence-gathering measures,"" Padilla added.      The AFP itself has not gone into details about the newly-reinstated CIG, including how big the unit would be and what its specific tasks will be. The group exists alongside the Intelligence Service of the AFP as separate units of the military.      Coup rumors       Its reactivation in the beginning of 2024 comes amid persistent rumors and speculation of misgivings and unrest among the military - retired soldiers, as well as those in active service.      No less than Brawner had  confirmed  in November 2023 that he had spoken to retired military officials behind a supposed plot to oust President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The AFP would try to walk back Brawner's statements, with then-AFP spokesperson Colonel Medel Aguilar claiming that the AFP chief was ""misquoted.""      Months later, on January 4, 2024, Brawner would  issue a statement  ""on the emerging challenges of 2024.""      The AFP chief, seemingly unprompted - not by the defense media, at least - said: ""The Armed Forces of the Philippines stands firm in its unwavering loyalty to the Constitution and its solemn commitment to fulfill its mandate. The men and women of the AFP remain steadfast in their role as the guardians of our nation's sovereignty and defender of democratic principles.""      The New Year statement was preceded by a little-known retired military officer claiming loyalty to Vice President Sara Duterte, whom he said was ""president now.""      Several Marcos policies have, perhaps, contributed to unease in the military - or at least the perception of unrest. Marcos' former finance chief, in a surprise press conference in March 2023, announced that the President had given the green light for a dramatic change to the military's generous and expensive pension system.      Benjamin Diokno, who has since been replaced as economic team head, said then that Marcos was ""willing to spend his political capital"" to introduce military pension reform.      The Philippine government had also announced its intention to resume peace talks with the communists. Rappler executive editor Glenda Gloria also noted Marcos' "" distance "" from military generals as another issue hounding the commander-in-chief.      In May 2023, in response to complaints from military generals, Marcos approved tweaks to a Rodrigo Duterte-era law that introduced fixed terms for the AFP's top officials.       During the 2024 New Year's call, Marcos said he had approved funds for rice subsidies and better medical service for the military. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/why-reactivate-armed-forces-counterintelligence-group/,Neutral,['retirement' 'stocks' 'mortgage']
2024-01-19 20:00:28,"Diokno's back, but Bangko Sentral 'not sure' if Ralph Recto will sit in its powerful Monetary Board","  It's a  ""return to his natural habitat""  for Benjamin Diokno as the former finance secretary and central bank governor comes back to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).       With his appointment as the latest Monetary Board member effective January 15, the BSP said that Diokno finally ""completes"" the 7-member Monetary Board (MB).      But even with Diokno's return, there are so far only six MB members who have been explicitly named - and newly-appointed Finance Secretary Ralph Recto isn't one of them.      Does that mean the BSP has chosen not to have the head of the Department of Finance on board?             Officials from the BSP responded in cautious tones.      ""Just to be clear, ' yung provision kasi, ang sinasabi  (the provision says), representative from the government,"" said Deputy Governor of the Corporate Services Sector Eduardo Bobier.      According to the New Central Bank Act, the MB must be composed of the BSP governor, who will serve as chairperson; five members of the private sector; and a member of the Cabinet designated by the President.      ""For now, there's an appointed secretary of finance but me personally, I'm not sure if the secretary of finance will sit as a member of the Monetary Board because the provision says representative from the government,"" Bobier said during a media information session on Friday, January 19.      Currently, the BSP publicly lists the names of six members of the Monetary Board: BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr., former finance secretary Benjamin Diokno, Bruce Tolentino, Anita Aquino, Romeo Bernardo, and former treasurer of the Philippines Rosalina de Leon.      In its press release announcing Diokno's appointment to the MB, the BSP merely listed the seventh member of the board as ""a member of the Cabinet designated by the President"" without mentioning any name.      The government representative chosen to sit on the MB is usually the secretary of finance. For instance, former finance secretaries Carlos Dominguez III and Cesar Purisima both served as members of the Monetary Board. But this isn't a hard and fast rule.      ""Just to cite past experience, there were times when the government representative in the board was the NEDA secretary.  Meron din time na  (There was also a time when) DTI was representing,"" said Deputy Governor of the Monetary and Economics Sector Francisco Dakila Jr.      Dakila may have been referring to Cayetano Paderanga Jr., the former secretary of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), who also sat as an ex officio member of the central bank's MB from 1990 to 1992.      Whoever is chosen to sit at the Monetary Board will take part in steering the country's monetary policy and supervising its financial institutions. Part of the board's responsibility is also  limiting inflation , which it controls by raising, lowering, or maintaining its key policy rate.

2024-01-19 17:30:00,FACT CHECK: Landbank's Gawad Patnubay scholarship program ended in 2022,"   Claim:  Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) posted an application link for its Gawad Patnubay Scholarship program for academic year 2024-2025.       Rating: FALSE       Why we fact-checked this:  The claim was made on January 16 in a post on the Facebook group ""4ps Nation Wide updates"" with 307,600 members as of writing.       The post claims that the application for the Landbank scholarship program is ongoing. The program supposedly offers students P18,000 for tuition fees, P3,000 for food allowance, and P10,000 for parents. Interested applicants are instructed to click the link provided in the post.      As of writing, the post has gained 829 reactions, 691 comments, and 109 shares.              The facts:  In a phone call with Rappler on Friday, January 19, Landbank confirmed that its  Gawad Patnubay Scholarship Program  officially closed in 2022 to give way to the bank's new program, the  Iskolar ng Landbank Program  (ILP).      The Gawad Patnubay Scholarship Program was an education-to-employment initiative for students specializing in the fields of agriculture and fisheries.         Iskolar ng Landbank program:  Launched in 2023, ILP is a nationwide college scholarship program supporting underprivileged but deserving students. Contrary to the misleading Facebook post's claim that the Landbank scholarship is open to all students, only the children or grandchildren of agrarian reform beneficiaries and small farmers and fisherfolk are eligible for the ILP.      According to Landbank, the application and screening of ILP scholars for academic year 2023-2024 has already ended. It will announce the next application cycle for academic year 2024-2025 through its official channels.       Fake links:  Following a  similar false claim  on a supposed scholarship program, Landbank  advised  the public to remain vigilant against scams circulating on Facebook, including fake scholarship application links.      On closer look, the supposed link for the scholarship application leads to a blog, not Landbank's  official website . The misleading Facebook post also includes comments from a user claiming to provide more information about the program through a private message. Providing personal information through dubious channels may put users at risk of falling victim to phishing scams.

2024-01-19 15:00:00,[Ask the Tax Whiz] Regular audit vs VAT audit,"  What is the difference between regular audit and VAT audit? Is there a possibility that a taxpayer can be subjected to both audits for the same year?      The key distinction lies in the type of taxes being audited. If a taxpayer is subject to a regular audit, it means that the examination of books of accounts and other accounting records includes All internal revenue taxes. In the case of a VAT audit, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) will only audit VAT compliance for a specific period, typically less than one year.      Yes. There is a possibility of receiving two Letters of Authority (LOAs) for both regular audit and VAT audit in the same year. However, it's crucial to note that the subsequent LOA should not include the tax type that is already under audit by the BIR. This means that if there's already a VAT audit, the regular audit for the same taxable year will no longer include VAT in their assessment.       What are the common issues that need to take note when receiving an LOA for an all taxes or VAT audit?      When receiving a Letter of Authority, it is essential to consider the types of taxes being audited by the BIR, the specific taxable period, the jurisdiction of the Revenue District Office, and the authorized person scrutinizing the accounting records. This awareness helps taxpayers understand which documents to present based on the provided checklist. If an LOA is issued to your office, you should ensure a timely response by presenting the books and other accounting records to their office. Once an assessment is issued, ensure that the protest is submitted on time.       If an ""All Taxes Audit"" is issued, you should ensure that the books of accounts and accounting records are accurate and timely declared in the tax returns filed, and that expenses are properly substantiated. Additionally, taxpayers required to withhold tax should also make sure that the tax withheld is properly remitted monthly and quarterly.      For the VAT audit, the BIR will be auditing a particular period of less than one year. The scrutiny will focus on sales and purchases. To prepare for this, make sure that your sales declaration is timely declared and properly classified as VATable Sales, VAT exempt sales, and zero-rated Sales. If you are claiming VAT exemptions or VAT zero-rating, you need to be able to present the special requirements.      For purchase transactions, you should verify if the input VAT claimed on the VAT return is properly supported with invoices. If you have importations, secure the importation documents from the Bureau of Customs.      In addition to filing VAT returns, taxpayers are also required to comply with the quarterly Summary List of Sales and Importations. This list can be used by the tax authority in assessing your taxes based on third-party information. You should ensure that all the declarations mentioned above are properly reported in these attachments.

2024-01-19 10:37:13,[ANALYSIS] Challenges that are holding down the market,"  I had some exchange of thoughts about the market with veteran stockbroker Ali Yu, president and market strategist of R. S. Lim & Co., Incorporated,  at the beginning of this week. While he maintains a positive outlook because of the country's improving economic situation, he could not just dismiss the inability - or rather ""hesitancy"" - of the market to break out from its immediate psychological resistance trading level of 6,700 of the PSEi.        As he puts it, ""this has remained a challenge.""      To recall, this trading level was almost everyone's closing forecast for last year. But as Mark Douglas pointed out in his book,  The Disciplined Trader  (now an industry classic), ""any trading level can be a turning point."" On the last trading day of 2023, the market stopped from its climb and slipped even lower to 6,450.04.      Like Yu, my circle of other friends and colleagues in the industry is attributing the current behavior of the market to some perceived common possible dangers.        One of this is the harm the market may suffer from the current grumblings on our local political front. When out of control, it may create greater damage to what the market has been sustaining from the present tensions in the West Philippine Sea, the war in Israel and Gaza strip, in the Red Sea and Ukraine. It could certainly spell disaster for the market.        To review, the House of Representatives has declared that among its priority projects for 2024 is the move for charter change. The Senate, for its part, has shown little enthusiasm due to differences in the focus and scope of the changes to be made. Then out of the blue, the  ""People's Initiative"" or PI movement  came to fore.                         Must Read                          How Philippine economy opened up to the world without charter change                                                                                         Behind the PI movement is the so-called People's Initiative for Reform Modernization and Action or PIRMA (the Filipino word for ""signature""). This is the group that sprouted at the tail-end of the presidency of the late Fidel Ramos. They started a signature campaign for amending the Constitution, such as shifting to a parliamentary system of government and the lifting of term limits on elected officials, among others.          The ""People's Initiative or PI"" is one mode for constitutional amendment provided by the Constitution. It recognizes the power of the people to propose amendments to the Constitution or to propose and enact legislations through a plebiscite called for the purpose.      The market is disturbed by the initial  negative methods  ascribed to the efforts for charter change. The progress of efforts to iron them out as of late, however, are encouraging.      New Cabinet movements      The recent movements in the Cabinet are received cheerfully by the industry. Among which is the appointment of former Deputy Speaker  Ralph Recto to the post of finance secretary .        However, there are pressing issues the market would like the new finance secretary should immediately look at. This is aptly articulated by a former colleague in the industry and now Albay 2 nd  District Representative, Joey Sarte Salceda.        First is the government's VAT digitalization efforts. ""We are in the awkward position of being among the first to propose a digital services VAT, and the last in the ASEAN-6 to actually pass such a tax; ""we need to address this (posthaste),"" according to Salceda.        Second is the issue of tapping added revenues from electronic commerce. It is now the driving force of consumer demand. This space, according to Salceda, escapes the reach of taxation.  It has remained ""di minimis"" to the government. But if properly addressed, it may no longer appear as something trivial but an important source of added revenues.        Of urgent need, according to Salceda, is requiring ecommerce platforms to ensure tax payment compliance of their sellers, and creating similar mechanisms for cash-on-delivery transactions.       Another concern is the tobacco excise tax collections. As pointed out by Salceda, there is an urgent need to figure out how to replace this declining source of revenue stream. In Salceda's calculations, it could collapse by as much another P45.0 billion this year due to ""substitution effects"" from vaping.      Salceda recalled that Recto was an advocate in the past of using Republic Act 8794, otherwise known as the Motor Vehicle User Charge (MVUC) or the Anti-Overloading Act of the Philippines, to finance public transport.        In this connection, Salceda is optimistic about the proposals he spearheaded to update the MVUC rates which can be used ""to heavily subsidize the jeepney modernization program.""      Fearless market forecasts      As of this writing, the market has not broken the 6,700 level.  In fact, it even receded a few more points lower than this target.        Yet, the enthusiasm of all those I have talked to, has not diminished.  As Yu expressed it, ""we should see some stronger support soon.""  This is because ""this is the quarter season to position for the year,"" he added.      My longtime friend stockbroker, Rene de los Reyes of Abacus Capital & Investment Corporation, harbors an unconditional positive outlook as well. He is confident that the doubts around charter change will be resolved out of the honesty of the intentions on the matter.       According to De los Reyes, the market breakout will be triggered by the reduction of interest rates, which to him is just ""a matter of when, not if.""      Jofer Gaite, president and chief trader of Westlink Global Equities, Inc., likewise expressed confidence that the market is bound to go higher. ""This will be triggered by the return of foreign funds, together with the easing of interest rates, and actual GDP growth.""                         Must Read                          How El Nino threatens emerging market economies like the Philippines                                                                                         The projected El Nino in the summer months, according to Gate, might cause a pullback as rice production takes a hit. As everyone has learned, ""inflation ticks higher when rice prices rise.""      The most bullish among my young colleagues is Joel de la Pena, market strategist and chief trader of H.E. Bennett Securities, Inc.  Out of the market's daily transactions, he considers the market to have broken the 6,700 level for all intents and purposes.        What is holding back the market from actually doing so, according to him, is the impact of the trading activities of foreign investors. They tend to sell when it is about to hit it and buy back after retreating several points lower. A great believer in what the  Maharlika Investment Fund  can do to prop up the market, he awaits with bated breath the scheduled roll out of its funds by March.  He is particularly excited by the expressed intention of the MIF to invest in Synergy Grid & Development Phils., Inc. (SGP) - his star stock pick in addition to another favorite, Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC).      De la Pena sees the market to climb before the second quarter and estimates that the PSEi will hit the 7,000 level by midyear.       Information on SGP      The following information on SGP that is literally lifted from the PSE's website will possibly make you understand Dela Pena's great enthusiasm on the stock: ""On December 20, 2019, SGP entered into a share swap transaction with the stockholders of One Taipan Holdings, Inc. (OTHI) and Pacifica2 Holdings, Inc. (P21).        As a result, SGP owned 67% of the outstanding shares of each OTHI and P21. OTHI owns controlling shares in Monte Oro Grid Resources Corporation (MOGRC), which holds 30% plus one share in National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). P21 owns controlling shares in Calaca High Power Corporation (CHPC), which in turn owns 30% minus one share in NGCP.       The share swap transaction was undertaken to formally consolidate the two major shareholders' ownership and control of NGCP through a common corporate structure. Accordingly, the effective ownership of SGP in NGCP will be 40.20%, with control of 60% voting rights through subsidiaries MOGRC and CHPC.""      Don't miss out on succeeding articles.

2024-01-18 15:30:00,Alliances over blood ties? Imee Marcos traces roots of rift with cousin Martin Romualdez,"              It seems that blood isn't thicker than water for Senator Imee Marcos.       For the first time, the senator admitted her rift with her cousin, Speaker Martin Romualdez, which she said stemmed from her decision to  side with the Dutertes  in the tiff with the House of Representatives.       ""Si Speaker, alam ko may tampo sa akin mula pa October. Bakit ako kumakampi sa mga Duterte? Sabi ko hindi ako kumakampi. Sa akin lang kasamahan natin ‘yan, kaalyado natin ‘yan. Higit sa lahat, kaibigan na wala namang ginagawang masama, bakit natin aawayin?""  Marcos told reporters on Tuesday, January 16, when asked about her relationship with Romualdez.       (I know that the Speaker has been upset with me since October. Why am I siding with the Dutertes? I told him I am not. For me, they are our allies. And most of all, they are our friends, they're not doing anything wrong, why would we fight with them?)             The senator said she could not understand why Romualdez had targetted former president Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.       ""Kasagsagan noong [confidential funds], ICC lahat ng issues sa mag-amang Duterte. Sabi ko nga, bakit natin inaaway? ‘Di ko magets,""  she added. (It happened at the height of the confidential funds and ICC, issues related to the father and daughter. I asked, why are we fighting with them? I don't get it.)       The House had earlier junked the confidential fund requests of the Vice President for 2024. Resolutions were also filed in the House urging the Marcos government to cooperate in the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into Duterte's bloody drug war.      The senator also said she did not see eye to eye with Romualdez on various matters, including prioritizing constitutional amendments.       ""Trabaho lang ito. Hindi naman ako galit sa kanya. Ang problema talaga hindi kami magkasundo sa pananaw at hindi ako naniniwala na pinakaimportanteng bagay ang pagbabago ng Constitution. Hindi siya na pinagkakaabalahan ang pamliyang Pilipino,""  Marcos said.       (This is just work. I'm not mad at him. The problem really is that we have differing views and I believe that amending the Constitution is not the most important thing. This is not the main concern of Filipino families.)      In November, Imee had warned that it would be a ""cause of great shame"" for Filipinos if the Philippine government would agree to cooperate with the ICC. She has been openly expressing opposition to her own brother's policies. In September 2023, she  joined a protest  calling for the resignation of her brother's then-finance chief, Benjamin Diokno.

2024-01-18 09:36:18,EXPLAINER: Recto eyes making companies pay for pollution they create,"  MANILA, Philippines - Newly appointed Finance Secretary Ralph Recto is calling for a study to make people and companies pay for the pollution they create in a bid to make the Philippines ""move towards a greener future"" and boost the country's fiscal space.      Recto is looking at a study of what's referred to as carbon pricing instruments, which refer to policy tools designed to look at the costs of carbon emissions and encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.       These policies basically put a price tag on carbon emissions, making emitters accountable for their contribution to global warming.      ""Carbon pricing instruments serve as a powerful fiscal tool, allowing us to incorporate the social and external costs associated with carbon emissions,"" Recto said during a technical working group meeting with environment agencies and multilateral lenders last January 16.      There are two main types:      Carbon Taxes      The World Bank defines carbon pricing as a straightforward fee on the pollution caused by using certain fuels or products. The more pollution a company or a household creates, the more they have to pay. This, in theory, encourages companies to find cleaner ways of doing things.      There are around 40 countries and over 20 cities that have some form of carbon pricing mechanism, according to the multilateral lender.      Since 2019, every jurisdiction in Canada has adopted some form of carbon tax. Each state has its own unique pricing system, but a national minimum standard is put into place.       The  Canadian government  imposes a regulatory charge on fossil fuels like gasoline and gas, and an output-based system for industries.       Territories decide on how to reinvest the collected taxes. Most provinces give most of fuel charge proceeds back to families through annual tax returns.       For households that upgrade to cleaner vehicles, they reduce their carbon taxes while still collecting incentives in full.      The main criticism for carbon taxes is that it may lead to increased costs for businesses and individuals and may disproportionately affect lower-income families.                       Must Read                          EXPLAINER: Why carbon capture is no easy solution to climate change                                                                                         Emissions trading systems      According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), emissions trading systems (ETS) allow governments to set a limit on how much pollution can be emitted. Should companies exceed the cap, they would have to trade permits to pollute.       Companies that can reduce pollution can then sell their ""leftover"" pollution permits to companies that find it harder to cut emissions.      The World Bank said caps create supply and demand for what's referred to as emission allowances, and effectively establishes a market price for greenhouse gas emissions.      The government also has an option to auction emissions credits to the highest bidder, making it a good revenue source for infrastructure and social programs.      The European Union (EU) has an ETS, where companies in energy-intensive industries like oil refinery, aviation, and maritime transport are required to participate.       Revenues from the ETS are mostly put into national budgets. Member states usually allocate these in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.        Some of the issues pointed out by the IEA include complexity in implementation, volatility of prices that result in business uncertainty, and even market manipulation.      Recto's concerns      The Philippines' Department of Finance underscored that the country's contribution to global warming is a meager 0.48% of total global carbon emissions.       But the country has put forward an ambitious commitment of reducing emissions by 75% by 2030 under its Nationally Determined Contribution to the  Paris Agreement .      Recto emphasized the need to extend the focus beyond mere transformations within industrial sectors, emphasizing research and development and incentivizing behavioral change.      He also said there is a need for extensive research for both policy and regulation to determine the best mode of carbon pricing for the Philippines.      ""There is increased momentum in the establishment of carbon pricing systems in the Asia-Pacific region. This presents an opportunity for the Philippines to not only keep the pace, but to lead with determination,"" Recto said. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/explainer-ralph-recto-eyes-companies-pay-pollution-carbon-tax/,Neutral,['stocks' 'retirement' '']
2024-01-17 15:56:49,[OPINION] Panay pretexts and power plays,"  Most of the calls for accountability for the  system-wide blackouts that swept over Panay  follow a playbook systematically unfolding against the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), the corporation that holds the operate and maintain (O&M) franchise of assets owned by the National Transmission Corporation (Transco). The O&M privatization followed the Arroyo administration's Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA).      Given the terrible mess we now suffer in the energy industry, our continuing dependence on dirty and dollar-depleting fuels, the shortage of adequate baseload capacity, unaffordable electricity rates that double outside the Luzon franchise areas despite the presence of nationwide subsidies, the lack of competent policy-making officials and regulators, and the prevalence of crony and oligarchical rent-seekers, EPIRA now seems to be one of the worst laws ever woven and passed.       Ironically, among its weavers, one sewer at the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) now presides over it. So are a number of the lawmakers behind it still among those influencing the current Marcos administration. Worsening the irony, these presidential whisperers include those who wove into EPIRA the privatization of Transco's O&M to operating and transmission technology providers with an umbilical to a hostile foreign state.      The Sinophobia behind the blame-game surrounding the Panay blackouts is undeniable. Latent geopolitical tinderbox realities warped from economic dependence under the Arroyo administration to an adversarial schizophrenia between China and the Philippines. It does not help that the switches and dials controlling the transmission monopoly  is in the same hands as those squeezing the triggers of water cannons in the West Philippine Sea.       Equally undeniable but tragically hilarious are proffered precipitous propositions by energy officials sparked by the Panay polemics that the O&M portion of the Transco privation be revoked and re-bid.      Why is that funny? It was proposed by factotum complicit in the privatization to a foreign state in the first place. How spineless is that where the inconsistency and betrayal of primary principles threaten serious constitutional consequences?                       Must Read                          Visayas brownouts to continue as NGCP sees -178 MW deficit                                                                                         Of lesser concern are consequences threatening potential Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) foreign investment where investors undertake CAPEX expansion but are denied sufficient profit and loss venues to recoup from risks taken and capital assets spent on.      The Panay blackouts are archetypal microcosms of incompetent energy governance from the Arroyo administration now reprised under Ferdinand R. Marcos. From the current Panay patsy being demonized to pretexts and power plays involving corporate acquisitions that seasoned professionals see through, allow us to analyze the Panay outages based on its factual details set against established and automatic grid code responses previously formatted under far more competent regulatory administrations. Finally, let us see what should have kicked-in within hours, instead of the systemwide collapse suffered by Panay.      When two Panay generating units went offline (one on scheduled maintenance, the other from a pump problem), the grid remained balanced enough to continue without collapsing. To prevent a tripping cascade, a load-dropping system typically kicks-in where automatic load dropping (ALD) or manual load dropping (MLD) protocols prevent a systemwide collapse.      Low megawatt plants cannot trip higher baseload megawatt plants. Since a 150-MW unit was already on scheduled maintenance, its size alone triggers a red alert status. Thus, the only unexpected variable that could cause a cascading trip was the 82-MW unit with a pump problem.      And yet officials would have us believe that a small offline 82-MW unit tripped a larger 135-MW coal-plant and four others thus collapsing the whole grid affecting Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guimaras, and Iloilo. That's ridiculous.        Unfortunately, the privately-owned distribution utility (DU) that had recently taken over from the previous Panay Electric Corporation (PECO, the Panay equivalent of Meralco) failed to switch to either ALD or MLD despite the red alert status. Throughout the tripping cascade, for over two hours, no ALD or MLD was implemented despite being based on constantly calibrated system frequencies at DU (not transmission) substations to prevent a collapse beyond the grid.      The takeover of PECO had set the basis for the expansion of its politically-granted franchise area which eventually included the acquisition of three electric cooperatives (ILECO 1,2, and 3) previously under the Iloilo Electric Cooperative (ILECO).      Had ALD or MLD been activated upon the DU's initiative once 82-MW went offline, power should have been restored within hours depending on the fuel-type of the generating units where coal-fired plants like the tripped 135-MW unit can take from several hours to half a day while diesels like the DU's own barge units can fire up within an hour.                     Play  Video                     Curiously, in intervals, the Panay blackouts lasted for more than a day. Given the long-prevailing thin market capacity and ancillary reserves from Panay's already inadequate baseload capacity and its dependence on only two in-island major baseload sources, what the generator (Panay Energy Development Company) should have done upon the red alert raised by NGCP was to coordinate directly with its DU to operationalize the DU's ALD or MLD as is the protocol in the Luzon franchise. That did not happen.      The Panay systemwide grid collapse that blacked-out even the expanded DU franchise areas was a resource and supply dependability problem. Not only were grid-balancing ancillary reserves insufficient in Panay as they were centered mostly in Cebu but the whole Visayas has the lowest planning reserve margin (PRM) with absolutely no resource adequacy ratio (SAR) study. Pre-determining both, as is typical globally, is the responsibility of policy and regulatory officials concomitant with their duty to periodically re-reprice transmission and distribution utility rates to compel and enable asset and systems upgrades.      Instead, the DOE, regulators and bully pulpit grandstanders blame their go-to private-sector patsy ignoring the reality that sufficient baseload has not been added to the Panay grid. The finger-pointing likewise ignores the regulator's failure to periodically re-calibrate rates where returns on the mandated weighted average costs of capital (WACC) allow either upgrading the Cebu-Negros-Panay submarine cable or ensure sufficient on-grid ancillary reserves.      As it stands, due to regulatory dereliction and the DOE's failure to attract adequate onsite market capacity for Panay, relying mostly on the current un-upgraded submarine cable, NGCP can only supply 19% of Panay's needs.  - Rappler.com        Dean de la Paz is a former investment banker and managing director of a New Jersey-based power company operating in the Philippines.

2024-01-17 15:02:50,Where do senators stand on charter change?,"  MANILA, Philippines - The fresh push for Charter change (Cha-Cha) is making headway after Senate President Migz Zubiri said that the upper chamber will take the lead in reviewing amendments to the Constitution's economic provisions.      Zubiri made the announcement on Monday, January 15, after meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and House Speaker Martin Romualdez earlier this month.       It was a different tune for Zubiri as he had opposed moves for Cha-Cha last year during his first year as  Senate leader.       ""The President agreed with us that the proposal was too divisive, and asked the Senate to instead take the lead in reviewing the economic provisions of the Constitution. In this way, we can preserve our bicameral nature of legislation,"" he said on Monday.       Zubiri himself filed his own proposal to amend certain economic provisions of the Constitution.  Senators Sonny Angara and Loren Legarda were co-authors.                   Play  Video                     Zubiri's proposal only includes amendments to the operation of public utilities and education services. It has no political proposals, such as lifting term limits.        To reassure the public, Zubiri said the President wants the House to adopt the upper chamber's Cha-Cha version to rule out any amendments outside the economic provisions.      Zubiri's resolution needs 18 votes from senators. The review will be led by Angara who chairs the finance committee.      But where do his colleagues stand on Cha-Cha?       Senator Nancy Binay      In a statement on Tuesday, January 16, Senator Nancy Binay said that she is in favor of Cha-Cha but it should ""strictly focus"" on amending the Constitution's economic provisions.       ""Given the economic drive to establish a stronger platform for investments and national development,  siguro  (maybe), as a starting point, the Senate can task the sub-committee to provide a forum to a healthy and sensible debate on whether or not there's a need to amend the Constitution,"" Binay said.       Senator Koko Pimentel      In a text message to Rappler on Tuesday night, Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel said he is in favor Cha-Cha through a constitutional convention (Con-Con).       ""Given the recent developments, I now believe that calling for a constitutional convention would be the best way forward in revising the Constitution,"" he said.       In the current proposal for Cha-Cha, proponents are calling for a constituent assembly (Con-Ass), where Congress will convene to change the institution, while if via a Con-Con, the delegates will either be appointed or elected by the people.      Senator Robin Padilla      Senator Robin Padilla welcomed Zubiri's move to start discussion on amending the charter.       ""This is good news for the nation. Our economy will be revitalized, and this will lead to progress in the lives of Filipinos,"" Padilla said.       Padilla led the Cha-Cha push in 2023 but it fizzled out. (READ:  In Cha-Cha push, can Padilla invite House lawmakers to Senate hearings? )      Senator Imee Marcos      The President's sister, Senator Imee Marcos, is not in favor of Cha-Cha. In her latest statement on Tuesday, she said that opening up the economy to the world has already been done even without Cha-Cha.       ""Parang ang labo, at sa education naman, parang isu-surender ba natin kinabukasan ng ating anak sa dayuhan? Baka pag laki niyan ‘di na natin sila kilala kasi mga foreigner na sila, ‘wag naman 100%,""  Marcos said.       (It's not clear, and on opening up education, it's like do we want to surrender the future of our children to foreigners? We might not know them anymore when they grow up because they'll be foreigners, so let's not open up education 100 percent.)      Meanwhile, the following senators released their statements before Zubiri filed the resolution on Monday. Rappler will update this story if they change their position.       Senator Joel Villanueva      In a statement on January 11, Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva said that Cha-Cha advocates should not deceive the people that the country needs to amend the Constitution to ""solve society's problems.""       ""Tigilan na po ang paglapastangan at pagmamanipula sa ating mga kababayan. Marunong silang mag-isip. Hindi nabibili ang kanilang opinyon. Hindi for sale ang Pilipino,""  he said.       (Let's not disrespect and manipulate our countrymen. They know how to think. Their opinions can't be bought. Filipinos are not for sale.)      Senator JV Ejercito      Senator JV Ejercito on January 12 said that the Philippines has ""too many problems to fix,"" and these should be tackled first instead of undertaking Cha-Cha.       ""Too many problems to fix, too many challenges that need attention, early political bickerings and charter change will surely affect goals that [have] been laid down,"" Ejercito said.       ""Personally, I would rather concentrate on surmounting these challenges,"" he said.       Senator Win Gatchalian      In a statement on Tuesday, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian emphasized that the upper chamber will only look at the economic provisions of the charter and will ""not talk about the political aspect."" He, however, said that this will not be approved before the President's third State of the Nation Address (SONA) in July.      ""I think this will not be approved before the SONA as this will take time to discuss and debate. PI [People's Initiative] should stop already,"" he said.      Senator Risa Hontiveros      Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros cautioned her colleagues that Cha-Cha is ""treacherous, impractical, divisive, and unwise.""      ""Why are we attempting to solve our economic problems by creating another problem?"" she asked.      Hontiveros said that opening up 100% of the country's public utilities and education services to foreigners ""only expose us to security risks and weaken our national interests in a time of global unrest.""      We will update this story once more senators give their positions on Cha-Cha.  - Rappler.com                                 ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/where-senators-stand-charter-change-january-2024/,Neutral,['stocks' 'retirement' '']
2024-01-17 12:50:05,Take 2 for Manny Villar's Channel 2?,"  When ALLTV, the first major entertainment venture of the  Philippines' 2nd richest individual  - former senator Manny Villar - was launched in September 2022, there was high expectation that it would present a credible competition to industry leaders such as  GMA Network  and  TV5 .      Its biggest asset was ABS-CBN's coveted frequency: Channel 2, which the  Lopez family lost in 2020 . Many people wanted to know how Villar's Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS), which operates ALLTV, would use this pubic resource after  securing the frequency in 2022 . Would they also use it for news, public service, and education aside from entertainment?              ""Ito ang bagong Channel 2  (This is the new Channel 2),"" declared Willie Revillame, Villar's friend and unofficial point man for ALLTV, on September 13, 2022.  ""Pasisiyahin namin kayo umaga hanggang gabi  (We will entertain you from morning until night).""       The official launch of ALLTV was held at Vista Land's Wil Tower condominium rooftop at the back of the ABS-CBN compound in Quezon City.       With one of the country's top tycoons behind this new network, many thought ALLTV would give others in the Philippine broadcast industry a run for their money.       And why not? It even scored an interview, with no less than the then-new president, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., via former  Kapamilya  star Toni Gonzaga. It aired on his 65th birthday, or just over two months following a resounding  victory in the 2022 presidential elections .                    Play  Video                     AMBS would go on to  sign deals with Revillame , Gonzaga, and her husband Paul Soriano; Mariel Rodriguez, actress and wife of  Senate topnotcher Robinhood ""Robin"" Padilla ; Ciara Sotto, singer/fitness enthusiast and a daughter of former Senate president Tito Sotto; and former  Kapamilya  broadcast talent Anthony Taberna. AMBS also signed a partnership with CNN Philippines on the airing of its flagship news program,  News Night .       AMBS' high-profile celebrities would have station-produced shows on ALLTV, until the network hit pause for most of these shows starting February and March 2023, or just five to six months after the station's launch.       There was talk that Villar balked at the high fees for these talents and cost of producing their shows, with little prospects of getting revenues from advertisers. It was reported by entertainment website pep.ph in April 2023 that Revillame had  terminated his contract with AMBS .       Incumbent Senator Mark Villar would quash talk that his father was giving up on ALLTV by telling Taberna in February 2023 that the station would not close down and was just undergoing changes.       That pause has taken months - until signs of new activity began toward the end of 2023.       Well, it appears Villar is giving his entertainment venture a second shot, with initial priority to AMBS' flagship radio station, K-Lite 103.5 FM, which is housed in Villar's Star Mall EDSA-Shaw in Mandaluyong City.               For one, K-Lite 103.5 FM rebranded starting January 1, 2024 into ALLRADIO. This station provides piped music to  Villar's expanding retail  and food empire such as its Coffee Project outlets,  All Home  and  AllDay  stores, plus his  Vista Malls  and  Star Malls .       Secondly, ALLRADIO now has regular five-minute news programs - three times a day, at 11:55 am, 2:55 pm, and 5:55 pm.       ALLTV Channel 2 has recently been airing a news ticker which says, ""Watch out for the simulcast airing of ALLTV News, Monday to Friday, on ALLRADIO, ALLTV News FB, and ALLTV.""       ALLRADIO has picked a former DZMM and  Kapamilya  radio reporter, Zandro Ochona, as one of its news readers.       In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Ochona announced he was back on radio and invited his followers to ""join us at ALLRADIO 103.5FM.""           2023 is the year I came back on radio.  More than a year ago I said goodbye to broadcasting to spend more time with my family, especially my parents who are both retired now.  This year while I was literally climbing a mountain, I got a call from a colleague who invited me to go...  pic.twitter.com/xXQxU66gTa  — Zandro Ochona (@ZandroOchona)  December 31, 2023            And, it appears more changes at the station are forthcoming. Ochona posted on January 8,  ""Marami pang surpresa sa darating na panahon. Abangan.  (More surprises coming soon. Watch out.)""      On ALLTV's Facebook, it seems the page will be more active in the coming months in the run-up to the 2025 mid-term elections. It recently posted Villar's congratulatory greeting to  new Finance Secretary Ralf Recto , his former colleague in the Senate.               Villar recalled that he and Recto were part of the so-called ""Wednesday Club"" group with the  late Joker Arroyo  and several other senators.       ALLTV Facebook has also been posting videos of its short news programs which air on ALLTV.               There's no sign that the prominent celebrities of ALLTV will be returning on Channel 2 with revived programs, so it appears to be a low-cost take 2 at the moment. The television station continues to air mostly reruns of  Kapamilya  movies, K-drama, and other low-cost entertainment. Gonzaga, however, has been consistent in pursuing her show, Toni Talks, online, absent a television platform.  - Rappler.com       ALSO ON RAPPLER         2022 Forbes list: Sy siblings still richest in PH, Villar is biggest gainer        FAST FACTS: Media Serbisyo, Martin Romualdez's joint venture with ABS-CBN        TV5 upgrades transmission towers amid entertainment shake-up        Mapping the businesses of Speaker Martin Romualdez        Romualdez's Prime Media says joint venture with ABS-CBN only for radio, not TV     ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/manny-villar-alltv-channel-2/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-17 12:22:34,Musk wants 25% voting control at Tesla before fulfilling AI goal,"  Tesla CEO Elon Musk  said  he would be uncomfortable growing the automaker to be a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without having at least 25% voting control of the company, nearly double his current stake.      Musk said on Monday, January 15, in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that unless he got stock in the world's most valuable automaker that was ""enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,"" at Tesla, he would prefer to build products outside of the electric-vehicle manufacturer.      Musk's warning about developing AI and robotics outside Tesla unless he gets more voting control could infringe on his duties as CEO, governance experts and analysts said.      He has long touted Tesla's partially automated ""Full Self-Driving"" software and its prototype humanoid robots, but the electric-vehicle maker generates most of its revenue from its automotive business.      He also promoted Tesla's Dojo supercomputer to train AI models, which Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in September could boost its market value by almost $600 billion by helping to speed up its foray into robotaxis and software services.      Tesla's shares inched up 0.5% on Tuesday, but have fallen by more than 11% since the start of the month.      Musk, the world's richest person, currently owns around 13% of Tesla stock after selling billions of dollars of shares in 2022 partly to help finance his $44 billion purchase of Twitter.      In a separate post on X, he said he would be fine with a dual-class share structure to achieve his goal of getting 25% voting control, but was told it was impossible after Tesla's initial public offering.      ""It's weird that a crazy multi-class share structure like Meta has, which gives the next 20+ generations of Zuckerbergs control, is fine pre-IPO, but even a reasonable dual-class is not allowed post-IPO,"" he said, referring to the Facebook parent's founder Mark Zuckerberg.      Companies with dual-class structures have two or more types of shares with different voting rights - usually one with greater voting rights for founders or early investors and another for other shareholders with less voting power.      Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.      Musk currently faces a lawsuit over his compensation package. Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta sued Musk and the board in 2018 and hopes to prove the co-founder used his dominance over Tesla's board to obtain an outsized compensation package that did not require him to work at the EV maker full-time.      Musk said on X there was no ""feud"" with the board over his new compensation package and  said  the pending verdict was holding back the discussions.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/technology/elon-musk-wants-more-voting-control-tesla-before-fulfilling-artificial-intelligence-goal/,Neutral,['stocks' 'retirement' '']

2024-01-16 15:31:49,"Councilor files complaints against mayor, 12 other local officials in Pampanga town","  PAMPANGA, Philippines - Local government officials of Mabalacat City, Pampanga, found themselves in the hot seat for alleged grave misconduct, graft and corruption in connection with the acquisition of land and construction of a proposed P2.1-billion five-story government center project.      Another P610 million which was also used to purchase the 2.1-hectare property in Barangay Camachiles (where the proposed government center will be constructed), is also being questioned by Councilor Jun Castro.      Aside from  Mayor Crisostomo Garbo  and Vice Mayor Gerald Aquino, nine councilors are said to be involved as signatories in the approval and signing of Appropriation Ordinance No. 05  during the 35th regular session of the Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP) in March 2023. They are councilors Timothy Paul Llanos Dee, Victor Tiglao II, Noel Castro, Elizabeth Pineda, Roland Pena, Jerry Magsino, Carlo Francis Dizon, Elmer Mendiola, and Hans Christian Balingit.      Castro, who was a former appropriations committee chair, refused to sign the ordinance because of lack of due diligence, while two other councilors, Cherry Manalo and Marjorie Sambo, were absent during the session.       Philreca Representative Presley de Jesus and Sta. Rosa City Representative Dan Fernandez filed House Resolution No. 1486 (HR 1486) in November 2023 directing the committee on public accounts to conduct an investigation into the alleged irregularities surrounding the Mabalacat City government center project.        Partial copy of House Resolution No. 1486. Photo by Joann Manabat       HR 1486 said that the 2023 annual investment plan of the local government of Mabalacat City did not include the construction of the government center project. It also said that the AIP should show the expenditures of the local government to serve as basis for the preparation of its annual and supplemental budget.      The resolution also said that Garbo allegedly entered into a loan agreement with Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) for P2.070 billion to fund the project without securing proper authorization from the city council.      Landbank, in a letter sent to Garbo last October, indicated the conditions for withholding the release of the loan:         A case being filed against the local government unit or its officials involved in the project to be financed       An adverse finding on the project or object of financing      Withdrawal of the city council  of the authority given to the local chief executive to contract the loan        Proof of termination, disposal, or dismissal of the cases must be submitted, the letter said, to avail of the loan.      The 2.1-hectare property was owned by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Incorporated (PLDT). In March 2023, Garbo signed the deed of absolute sale (DOAS) through Resolution No. 155.       Based on the DOAS, the total amount was ""P527.8 million with 12% value added tax. However, P610 million was the amount indicated for the acquisition of lot to be used for the proposed government center under the statement of supplemental appropriation programs, projects, and activities.""        Partial image of the statement of supplemental appropriation. Photo by Joann Manabat       A groundbreaking ceremony was also held in July 2023, coinciding with Mabalacat's 11th cityhood anniversary.      In April 2023, Castro filed a complaint before the Ombudsman against Garbo, Aquino, the 11 councilors, and City Treasurer Marlene Mendoza.       The Office of the Ombudsman, in September 2023, ordered them to file their counter-affidavits for alleged violations of Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.      Castro said a preliminary hearing had been set for January 31 at the Office of the Ombudsman.      ""For the information of everybody on the development of the case, we filed a case and then they sent counter affidavits. After they sent their counter affidavits, I also sent mine. And then the Ombudsman asked for the position paper of the respondents. The latest development after the position paper, a preliminary will be held on January 31, 9 am at the Office of the Ombudsman,"" said Castro.      In a statement, the city information office said that it has not received any new formal complaint and it refused to participate in the ""smear campaign.""      ""He (Garbo) will neither engage in unsubstantiated speculation by the councilor nor dignify his unfounded accusations with a response. The camp of the mayor refuses to partake in the smear campaign of the SP member, and remains focused on serving the best interests of the city,"" said city information office head Jay Pelayo IV.      The proposed plan to build a new government center was officially announced in October 2023, based on a press statement of  the city information office through the Mabalacat City News Facebook page.      If approved, the new government center will house the city hall and other essential government agencies to ""easily access vital services in a centralized location.""      The Mabalacat City hall is currently located at the northern part of the city in Xevera Complex, Barangay Tabun. It was inaugurated in 2009.

Play  Video                     This is a completely different tune for Zubiri as he was, in the past, totally against Charter change (Cha-cha) even for economic provisions. (READ:  Zubiri schools 'neophyte' Padilla over canceled Cha-Cha hearing )       ""While the Constitution must be reviewed in keeping with the demands of the present and the possibilities of the future, we believe that we must first exhaust all other avenues open to us, through policy-making and legislation,"" Zubiri said.       On Monday, Zubiri filed Resolution of Both Houses No. 6, ""proposing amendments to certain economic provisions of the 1987 Constitution."" He co-authored this with Senators Sonny Angara and Loren Legarda.       The resolution only includes amendments in the operation of public utilities and education services.       ""[The] nation's economic policy must be reframed under the demands of this increasingly globalized age, while still protecting the general policy of Filipino-first that guides the economic provisions of the Constitution,"" the resolution read.       ""Our children deserve to have access to the best educational institutions, both Filipino and foreign, to ensure that they receive the best training to become globally competitive citizens in the modern world,"" it added.             Zubiri said the instruction they got from Marcos was for the Senate to take the lead in reviewing the economic provisions of the Constitution which would be adopted by the House later on.        The Senate review on Cha-cha will be in the context of the Public Service Act (PSA), which was amended to allow foreign ownership in certain public services like airports, railways, expressways and telecommunications.      ""The Senate commits that it will work with the House of Representatives to remove all doubts on the constitutionality of the law by ensuring that the liberalized policies contained in the PSA can be implemented and relied on by investors as an enduring policy. It is only in this respect that the Senate can agree to modify the Constitution,"" Zubiri said.       Asked if Romualdez was amicable to it, Zubiri didn't give a direct answer but said it would be best for reporters to ask the House Speaker.       ""Best to ask him, I don't want to put words in his mouth. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But we're happy  sa kinalabasan ng meeting na ‘yan  (of what transpired in the meeting).""      ‘Synergy between Senate, House'      In a statement, Romualdez thanked Zubiri for the Senate's initiative in filing a Resolution of Both Houses of Congress.      ""The synergy between the Senate and the House in passing this Resolution will send a strong signal of unity and purpose. It aligns with the aspirations of the proponents of the ongoing People's Initiative, who have tirelessly advocated for constitutional reform,"" Romualdez said.      Romualdez, however, didn't categorically say that the House would adopt the Senate version in case it hurdles the upper chamber.      Zubiri's resolution needs 18 votes from senators. The review will be led by Angara who chairs the finance committee.      The Senate president tried to reassure those wary of Cha-cha that term limits will not be part of the amendments. But critics worry that once Congress green lights the process, it will be all too easy to go beyond economic amendments and sneak in provisions that will allow politicians to stay longer in power.  - Rappler.com               ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/zubiri-dances-charter-change-senate-lead-reviewing-economic-provisions/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-15 10:49:39,Why Canada wants closer ties with the Philippines in 2024,"  MANILA, Philippines - Canada is eyeing over CAD$15 million (approximately P625.8 million)* in aid for the Philippines over six years, as Ottawa made its pitch to strengthen ties with the Philippines, a minister said during an early January 2024 visit to Manila.      ""The Indo-Pacific strategy has a diplomacy component, a trade and investment component, and a significant development component. And that development envelope is for the entire Indo-Pacific region, but of course, the Philippines is part of that region. And so, we expect that some of that take-up will be from the Philippines,"" said Canadian Minister of International Development Ahmed Hussen in a media roundtable on Thursday, January 11.      During Hussen's visit to the Philippines, he had meetings with several Cabinet officials including Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga and National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, among others.      The Indo-Pacific strategy that Hussen was referring to is Canada's roadmap for its relations with the region, released only in 2023.      The opening paragraphs of the strategy reads: ""The Indo-Pacific is rapidly becoming the global centre of economic dynamism and strategic challenge. Every issue that matters to Canadians--including our national security, economic prosperity, respect for international law, democratic values, public health, protecting our environment, the rights of women and girls and human rights--will be shaped by the relationships Canada and its allies and partners have with Indo-Pacific countries.""      'Dinner table' concerns      Canadian Ambassador David Hartman often simplifies the importance of Philippine-Canadian bilateral ties this way: what happens in the Philippines and the greater Indo-Pacific is ""dinner table"" talk back at home.      Hussen shares the sentiment. ""Really, the familial and people-to-people relationship between the two countries is unparalleled. And it's a source of pride for so many of us. We are aligned on so many issues,"" added the minister, who last visited Manila in 2018 as immigration minister.      Canada is promising CAD$8 million (approximately P333.8 million) over five years to finance climate adaptation, including building ""resilience of vulnerable communities by supporting nature-based solutions."" Another CAD$7 million (approximately P292 million)   over six years has been earmarked to finance universal health care here.      ""The project plans to target vulnerable populations, including women and girls and indigenous people, in four geographically isolated and disaster-prone provinces,"" said the Canadian embassy in Manila.      The details of these planned projects have yet to be finalized - Hussen, after all, had just met with key officials in Manila.        BILATERAL TIES. Canadian Minister of International Development Ahmed Hussen speaks to Environment Secretary Maria Antonio Yulo-Loyzaga during the former's visit to Manila on January 11, 2024.        The plans are also only the beginning. Canada's agriculture minister, Lawrence MacAulay, will be visiting the Philippines in February 2024 just as their Indo-Pacific Agriculture and Agri-Food Office, a hub for the region, opens in Manila.      Canada is also eyeing a late-2024 visit of the jet-setting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to Canada. The two nations celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties in 2024.      The details of a possible visit have yet to be finalized, and negotiations are ongoing, said Canadian Ambassador to Manila David Hartman. ""The two countries are working on the technicalities of the visit, but we're very, very excited to see President Marcos,"" he said.      ""The President already has existing commitments in the Western Hemisphere, and so the likelihood is that he will be in the neighborhood. So, we're more or less looking at that time frame,"" the ambassador added.       Critical minerals, trade      The North American nation has also hyped the ""potential"" of private investments from Canada, particularly in developing the Philippine energy industry, infrastructure, and agriculture.      ""If we're talking about more resources, it's not just us picking up our game and increasing those dollars through the Indo-Pacific strategy. We have the opportunity to leverage some of those additional dollars to also unlock private sector dollars from Canada and...really deploy that in the Philippines. So I'm quite excited about the opportunities,"" said Hussen.      Hartman emphasized Canada's interest in critical minerals. ""One of the areas that we're really quite keen to pursue with the government of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, is the area of critical minerals.... The Philippines is the fifth most mineralized country on Earth. The crass reality is we cannot have a clean energy, a green energy transition without critical minerals,"" the ambassador said.      What's in it for Canada?       ""The candid reality is that the global community needs the Philippines. What Canada wants to be able to do is to be able to help the Philippines extract its mineral wealth responsibly, ethically, and in an environmentally sustainable and sound manner. Canada has a tremendous track record of being able to do that for ourselves back home,"" he added.      ""Critical minerals"" include copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements that are key in the shift to renewable or cleaner sources of energy ""from wind turbines and electricity networks to electric vehicles,"" according to the  International Energy Agency .      Alignment with its Indo-Pacific strategy, notably, is part of the ""next steps"" of Canada's critical minerals strategy.        TRADE TIES, TOO. Canadian Minister of International Development Ahmed Hussen meets with NEDA chief Arsenio Balisacan on January 11, 2024.       ""So it's not just through the bilateral envelope. There are opportunities through multilateral envelopes that Canada has put significant dollars in, which are available for the Philippines and other countries. And the Philippines is situated in a way to take advantage of those opportunities. That's part of the reason why I'm here, to talk about those opportunities,"" added Hussen.      Hussen said discussions with Cabinet officials here included how ""extensive resources"" from Canada's private sector - including managers of their pension funds - could see the Philippines as ""a very favorable market for foreign direct investment, to create win-win situations for both peoples here.""      ""And if you look at ASEAN [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations], this is a very favorable market. This is the market and the country that makes a lot of sense for Canadian foreign direct investment into the Philippines. Because, as I said, the affinity between the peoples, the business climate, and the strategic location of the Philippines,"" he added.      Defense ties, too      Earlier, Canada amped up defense ties with the Philippines.       In 2023, the two countries signed a deal that gave Philippine maritime agencies access to  Canada's Dark Vessel Detection system . It was a timely addition to the Philippines' resources, as it contends with China's growing aggressive actions in the South China Sea, particularly in the West Philippine Sea or within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.      Canada also announced plans to eventually sign a Visiting Forces Agreement with the Philippines. A VFA would make it easier for Canadian troops to participate in  joint exercises with other nations , among other things.      China's actions in the region, after all, are a concern for Ottawa, as expounded in its Indo-Pacific strategy.      Its 2023 strategy document reads: ""China's rapid and dramatic modernization of the People's Liberation Army, including its offensive technological capabilities and geographic reach, has caught the region's attention. As China becomes more assertive and grows in influence, Canada is stepping up as a reliable partner in the region to promote security and stability across the region and at home.""      Tensions in the South China Sea, in particular, are of concern not just to Canada but to the world: up to a third of global trade is estimated to pass through the waterway, making the freedom to navigate it crucial to global trade.  - Rappler.com       * CAD$1 is approximately = P41.72, as of posting   ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/why-canada-wants-closer-ties-philippines-2024/,Neutral,['credit cards' 'retirement' '']

2024-01-12 18:40:16,"[In This Economy] As new finance chief, will Ralph Recto usher in new taxes (again)?","  The cat is finally out of the bag.      On January 11, it was confirmed that Batangas 6 th  District Representative Ralph Recto  will be replacing  Benjamin Diokno as finance secretary.      For many months, Diokno dodged rumors and speculations by journalists. But there were telltale signs that Recto's appointment was impending. In November 2023, for instance, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.  brought with him  both Diokno and Recto at the APEC Summit in San Francisco.      Why was Recto chosen for this post?      There could be many political reasons. But one good justification is that Recto is credited (also heavily vilified) for advocating the  expanded value-added tax (EVAT) law  almost two decades ago.       That law, which raised the VAT from 10% to 12%, is often said to be the reason why Recto failed to snag a second senatorial bid in 2007.       But objectively, that law helped to save our economy already on the brink of fiscal crisis. If you know this bit of Philippine economic history, Recto's appointment as new finance secretary will make more sense.      Fiscal crisis and EVAT      The Philippine economy was in dire straits in the early 2000s.      It was so bad that in August 2004, 11 UP School of Economics professors teamed up to write a joint statement titled, "" The deepening crisis: the real score on the public debt .""       They cited grim statistics about the public coffers. In 2003, the total national government debt was measured at 78% of total national income, and increasing quite fast. (By comparison, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2022 was just 61%.)      Worse, if you add the debt of government corporations, the public debt at that time reached 130% of GDP!       One big reason for these disturbing numbers is that the government's budget deficit (or revenue shortfall) had ballooned since the late 1990s, largely because of ""falling revenue and tax efforts.""       What this all means is that by the early 2000s, the government was desperate for extra money. This is why the UPSE professors recommended that government ""raise revenues by closing off tax-loopholes, updating existing taxes, passing new revenue measures, and reallocating spending.""       The paper had a huge say in the debates at that time, culminating in the Recto EVAT law, which took effect on New Year's Day of 2006.      The graph below shows the macroeconomic impact of EVAT.      First, there was a notable increase in the government's revenue and tax efforts: revenues and taxes collected increased as a proportion of national income.       Second, in 2006, we came closest to having a ""balanced budget"" (revenues offsetting spending) since 1997. Of course, having a balanced budget has its own pros and cons. But from alarming levels, the deficit was brought down to less than 1% yearly from 2006 until 2008.      Third, the increased revenues and expanded fiscal space led to a shrinkage of domestic outstanding debt - the first time that happened since 1994.       Fourth, there was a record drop in the domestic debt-GDP ratio: 3.6 percentage points, a drop that has not been matched since.      In short, the EVAT law authored by Recto and others worked wonders. It was a bitter but necessary pill that contributed a lot to our economy's recovery and prevented a full-blown fiscal crisis.                  Of course, Recto can't take all the credit, and you could say that EVAT caused some pain, too: it raised prices for select goods and services, and that it was even regressive (roughly, hurting the poor more than the rich).      But one thing's for certain: many Filipinos have already forgotten the ills that EVAT was trying to solve, and did solve, thanks to the political will of Recto and other politicians who saw the need for such a measure - even at the cost of their political careers.       'Good economist'?      Fast-forward to January 2024, Recto will be at the helm of the Department of Finance. (Interestingly, from 2008 to 2009, after his failed Senate bid, Recto also had a brief stint as the head of the National Economic and Development Authority. So it won't be Recto's first time as an economic manager.)      In a statement, Recto's wife, acclaimed actress and politician Vilma Santos, said that President Marcos gave Recto the post ""because he is such a good economist.""       I'm not sure Recto can be called a bona fide economist. To be considered an economist, one needs at least a master's degree in economics. And in 2015, Recto  apologized  for falsely claiming that he finished two master's degrees, one in ""strategic business economics"" and one in public administration.       Recto is more like a politician who worked a lot on economic issues. But precisely for making tough calls at a crucial time in our economic history, I think his appointment as new finance secretary makes more sense than people will care to admit.       Having said that, Benjamin Diokno - who is rumored to be returning to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as the last new member of the Monetary Board - will be leaving behind important projects, such as raising revenues for the Marcos government and fixing the pension system of military and uniformed personnel (MUP).      The government right now is in desperate need for revenues. The debt-to-GDP ratio is still stubbornly above 60%, and key to bringing that down is to raise new taxes, even if that's unpopular.      Under Diokno's watch, the DOF already forecasted that it will need to raise an extra P120.5 billion in 2024, P152.2 billion in 2025, and P183.2 billion in 2026. That's a tall order.      Will Recto pull a Recto again, and muster the courage to push for new taxes? Maybe Recto will do a better job than Diokno in rallying politicians to enact key reforms. But only time will tell. If Recto himself has political goals in 2025, new taxes might hurt him (or maybe his wife Vilma) next year at the polls. So good luck raising new revenues.      It will also be interesting to see how Recto will work with the other economic managers, especially the new "" super economic manager ,"" Frederick Go, to whom he will need to report.       With many fiscal challenges ahead, we can only wish Recto: Good luck! -  Rappler.com         JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of   False Nostalgia: The Marcos ""Golden Age"" Myths and How to Debunk Them  .

He said he was surprised when Marcos suddenly announced a price ceiling on rice. When Marcos' cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, expressed openness to the idea to suspend fuel excise tax, he said it was bad for the economy.        But if there ever were rumors that underperformance led to Diokno's exit in the Cabinet, these were quashed by Marcos' message of gratitude towards the erstwhile finance chief.      ""We had to get our policies on to the right track, and he has done a splendid job as secretary,"" Marcos said.

2024-01-12 15:44:10,"Ateneo faculty members, students urge vigilance over suspended car park project","  MANILA, Philippines - The  suspension  of the Ateneo de Manila University's  North Carpark renovation project  should not lead to complacency, as those opposed to the move urged continued discussions on the issue.      Ateneo faculty members Remmon Barbaza, Tony La Vina, Arjan Aguirre, and Carmel Abao said this to concerned faculty and student members during a ""community kuwentuhan"" session on Friday, January 12, where they discussed future action points on the controversial project as students return to campus on Monday, January 15.      "" Mahalaga 'yung ating pakikisangkot kasi nakikinig ang administrasyon kasi natigil [ang proyekto]....

They are open to dialogue, but we are not sure until where these dialogues would happen.)       Abao said that the suspension of the project can be an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to engage with each other on the issue and find common ground.       ""At the end of the day...developing something within the campus, developing our land resources, [is] not a management prerogative. It's a community decision,"" she added.      The North Carpark renovation project aims to increase parking slots from 161 to 217 and promises to provide ""better pedestrian access, covered walkways, improved drainage, better traffic flow, and a rest area for drivers.""        More than 1,200 people have signed an  open letter  calling for the Ateneo administration to stop the project as of Wednesday, January 10. The plan was suspended a day later, on January 11.      Ateneo plans to hold an open forum on January 31 to discuss the project.      ""We hope it will be an opportunity for the stakeholders to share their opinions. The administrators will be there to listen to people,"" said Leland dela Cruz, Ateneo assistant vice president for social development, environment, and community engagement.       Dela Cruz added that administration officials are willing to listen to possible options and ideas on the  project ahead of the January 31 forum.       ‘ Lack of transparency ‘      During the community session, students and faculty cited the university administration's lack of transparency on the project.

The Sanggunian's School of Social Sciences representative Emmanuel Frodo Uranza said that the student government plans to release surveys to obtain insights of the Ateneo community on the issues, but sought help from the Ateneo community to support concerned organizations by amplifying their efforts.

Specifically, there is now a withholding tax of 1% imposed on half of the gross remittances by electronic-marketplace operators and Digital Service Providers to the online merchants for the goods or services sold through their facility.       This is not yet the digital tax. This withholding tax is in effect an advanced collection of the income tax due from the sellers/merchants. Upon filing and payment of income tax, the seller/merchant will apply the withheld amount as tax credit or deduction from its tax due.      Gross remittance, for purposes of this withholding tax, refers to the total amount received by an e-marketplace operator or digital financial service provider from a buyer/consumer through their platform/facility. However, gross remittances does not include:         Sales returns and discounts; s eparately billed delivery or shipping fee; and value added tax, collected by the e-marketplace operator from the online consumer and subsequently remitted to the online seller; and        Consideration for the use  of the e-marketplace and/or digital financial services platform.        In this case, the e-marketplace operator or digital service provider is the one who is required to deduct and withhold tax on the gross remittances in case the payment of sales of goods and services is made in their online platform before sending the remittances to the sellers/merchants.             I have a sole-proprietorship business which involves online selling. Will I be subject to the 1% withholding tax? What if I apply for BMBE certification?      Yes, but only on your online sales transactions since the e-marketplace operators or digital service providers are mandated to withhold 1% on  1/2  of their gross remittances to you. However, you are exempt from the withholding tax under the following circumstances:        If the   annual total gross remittances  to you (an online merchant) for the past taxable year has  not exceeded P500,000.00 ; or      If the  cumulative gross remittance  to you (an online merchant) in a taxable year has not exceeded  P500,000.00 ; or      If the seller/merchant is duly exempt from or subject to a lower income tax rate pursuant to any existing law or treaty (e.g., income tax exemption under the Barangay Micro Business Enterprise or BMBE law). Provided that, the concerned seller/merchant is able to secure the necessary certification, clearance,ruling, or any other document serving as  proof of entitlement to the said exemption or lower income tax rate . The said proof of entitlement shall be submitted by the seller/merchant to the e-marketplace operator or digital financial services provider concerned.        As mentioned above, if you have applied and secured a BMBE certification, then you will be exempted from the withholding tax.       I am an ordinary consumer who is using an online platform or an e-wallet. If I transfer cash to my nephews just because I want to, will I be subject to 1% withholding tax?      No. Ordinary remittance other than from sales or income payment will not be subject to withholding tax. The regulation refers to gross remittances from e-marketplace operators or digital service providers to their sellers/merchants. And the account used should be a BIR registered trade name of the seller or merchant, not a personal account.       As an online seller/merchant, what are the things that I need to take into consideration in complying with the Bureau of Internal Revenue?      In compliance with Section 236 of the NIRC of 1997, you have to register your business with the BIR.      As provided under RR 16-2023, e-marketplace operators shall require from their respective sellers/merchants the submission of their  Certificate of Registration (COR) or BIR form 2303 , and include the same as part of e-marketplace operators'  minimum seller/merchant accreditation requirements .      Aside from being registered with the BIR, it is imperative also for businesses to maintain a books of accounts and keep records, file and pay taxes on time, issuance of invoices receipts, and to comply with the other requirements that are applicable to your business.      Also, a merchant/seller must know that any transactions made within the Philippines are subject to Income Tax and Value Added Tax, unless otherwise exempted.      In a recent interview with the Philippine Tax Whiz, he mentioned that RR No. 16-2023 is simply expanding the scope of the withholding tax system and there's a need to ensure that our regulators, the BIR, are listening and will be coming up with new measures to at least ease the burden, especially the small ones.

2024-01-12 14:09:15,Diokno posts long list of achievements before stepping down as finance chief,"              MANILA, Philippines - Outgoing Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno on Friday, January 12, expressed confidence in his successor, House Deputy Speaker Ralph Recto, saying that he is ""pleased"" to turn over the Department of Finance (DOF) to the lawmaker.      Diokno is going back to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as a Monetary Board member, according to a statement from the Department of Budget and Management. He served as BSP Governor from 2019 to 2022.      Diokno already sits at the Monetary Board, as one seat is allocated for a Cabinet member.      But before returning to the central bank full-time, the DOF enumerated Diokno's achievements, noting that he is turning over the post with the Philippines ""on solid footing.""      ""I am proud knowing that I will be leaving my post at a time when the Philippine economy, in general, and the DOF, in particular, are in a better state of affairs than when I inherited them,"" Diokno said.

2024-01-11 20:06:30,LIST: Signs that Recto was replacing Diokno as finance chief,"  MANILA, Philippines - Political allies have congratulated House Deputy Speaker Ralph Recto on Thursday, January 11, for his appointment to the Department of Finance, hours ahead of an official announcement from Malacanang.      Recto's appointment was first confirmed by his wife, actress and former politician Vilma Santos-Recto. She said Recto's oath taking will take place on Friday, January 12.      Malacanang confirmed on Thursday evening that Recto will be taking his oath alongside Frederick Go, Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs.      Rumors of Recto replacing Benjamin Diokno as finance chief have been swirling for months.      Diokno earlier evaded questions about the then-loose talk on the Cabinet shake-up, noting that he does not comment on  rumors .       ""I don't know where it comes from. Why would I do that? We've assembled a great team.  At saka  (And also), we're trying to go down a certain direction,"" President Ferdinand Marcos  said  back in November 2022, when asked about talks that he was replacing Diokno.      ""It's a very, very poor time to, as I say, change horses in midstream,"" he added.      Here's a list of incidents that hinted of Diokno's exit from the Cabinet.       Rice price caps       In a briefing early September 2023, Diokno  admitted  that he was ""surprised"" by the sudden order of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to set  price ceilings  on rice.       "" Nasa Japan kami talaga when that was announced. Magkatabi kami ni Arsi ,"" Diokno said, referring to National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan.       "" Nagulat nga kami. Lumabas na agad e ,"" he told reporters on Friday, September 8.      (We were in Japan when it was announced. I was beside Arsi. We were surprised. It just came out suddenly.)      He also said that the President did not extensively consult the economic managers before issuing the contentious order. Diokno, however, still supported Marcos' price ceilings amid criticisms from economists. (READ:  Marcos' economic team backs rice price cap, group claims it's harmful )      Marcos' decision was criticized by former Finance Undersecretary Cielo Magno. She was eventually forced out of her post after posting a chart illustrating the law of supply and demand, the most basic chart in economics.                       Must Read                          'Nagulat nga kami': Diokno says rice price cap surprised even the economic team                                                                                          Fuel taxes       On September 19, Diokno issued a statement, warning that the proposal of several lawmakers, including Marcos' cousin, House Speaker  Martin Romualdez , of suspending  fuel taxes  would hurt government coffers and benefit only the rich. Instead, Diokno proposed targeted subsidies.      ""When you formulate policy, you always think of what's the greatest good for the greatest number,"" Diokno said.        Lobbying       There have been people lobbying for Recto's appointment to the Department of Finance.       One of them was Angkas CEO George Royeca.       In a  column  entitled ""A maestro for economic prosperity"" published in October 2023 at the  Philippine Star , Royeca openly endorsed Recto, even though Diokno was still finance chief at that time.      ""It is with great admiration and respect that I reveal this potential maestro of our economic prosperity, the one whose unwavering commitment to the betterment of our nation has been proven time and again. His name represents a wealth of experience and expertise in the fields of economics and finance…. None other than former Senate pro-tempore and current deputy speaker, Ralph Recto,"" Royeca said.       ""In the grand symphony of our nation's financial future, Ralph Recto is the conductor we need to orchestrate a harmonious and prosperous economic melody for all Filipinos to enjoy.""      Praises      In the absence of an official announcement, Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda's press release was entitled, ""On the likely appointment of Rep. Recto as Secretary of Finance.""      ""I am optimistic that key tax reforms pending in the Senate will also move faster with his appointment, due to his relationships in that chamber, as well as his ability to broker viable compromises,"" Salceda said.      Senate President Miguel Zubiri said Recto had the ability to bridge numbers and realities on the ground.      ""In the Senate, we always regarded him as the resident numbers genius. This was not just for his mathematical ability, but more importantly for his ability to immediately see the big picture implications of these numbers. More than most, he understands how to bridge the gap between the abstractions of mathematics and the very concrete realities that we face as a nation,"" Zubiri said.      Diokno's track record      Diokno has served four presidents. He was an undersecretary at the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) under the late former president Corazon Aquino. He went on to lead the DBM twice, under the presidency of Joseph Estrada from 1998 to 2001, and Rodrigo Duterte, from 2016 to 2019. He also served as the governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas from 2019 to 2022 before his appointment as Marcos' finance secretary.      Diokno has implemented several tax and fiscal reform measures throughout his career, including the 1986 tax reform which simplified income tax and introduced value-added tax (VAT). In 1991, he introduced reforms in the local government code.      During the Duterte administration, he worked with the economic managers to implement several packages of the controversial TRAIN law, which lowered income taxes but raised taxes on fuel and sugary drinks, and rationalized tax perks of corporations.      Recto and economic policies      Recto is no stranger to economic policy. He was the proponent of the unpopular expanded VAT, resulting in his failed reelection bid in 2007. Some economists, however, lauded the measure as it generated income for the government.      In 2008, Recto was appointed as director general of the National Economic and Development Authority by former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.      Recto authored and sponsored several economic laws, including the Rice Tariffication Act, the Rent Control Act, the Salary Standardization Law, Affordable Electricity Act, and the law taxing offshore gaming companies.       Recto  has a certificate in business economics from the University of Asia and the Pacific, and completed units in the public administration program of the University of the Philippines. He has a bachelor's degree in commerce from De La Salle University. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/list-signs-ralph-recto-replacing-benjamin-diokno-finance-secretary/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-11 08:50:08,Israel to face Gaza genocide charges at World Court,"              Israel prepared to defend itself on Thursday, January 11, at the top UN court against accusations of genocide in Gaza, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly rebuffed for the first time calls by some right-wing ministers to permanently occupy the enclave.      As Israel's war in Gaza continued to rage, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, also known as the World Court, was to hold hearings on Thursday and Friday in a case brought by South Africa in December claiming Israel's war against Hamas militants in Gaza violates the 1948 Genocide Convention.      Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said on Wednesday: ""Tomorrow, the State of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice to dispel South Africa's absurd blood libel, as Pretoria gives political and legal cover to the Hamas Rapist Regime.""      The hearings will deal exclusively with South Africa's request for emergency measures ordering Israel to suspend its military actions in Gaza while the court hears the merits of the case - a process which could take years. Colombia and Brazil expressed their support of South Africa late Wednesday.      Israel launched its offensive after Hamas fighters carried out an October 7 cross-border rampage in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 abducted.      Since then, Israeli forces have laid much of Gaza to waste, and nearly all its 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes at least once, causing a humanitarian catastrophe. More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed.      On the eve of the hearings, Netanyahu for the first time publicly stated opposition to calls from right-wing members of his government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, for Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily, making way for Israelis to settle there.      While the stance has been Israel's official policy, Netanyahu's prior comments on permanent occupation of Gaza have been inconsistent and at times opaque.      ""I want to make a few points absolutely clear: Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population,"" Netanyahu said on social media platform X.      Potentially timing his comments ahead of the ICJ hearings, he added: ""Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law.""      Jordan and Egypt warned on Wednesday against any Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and appealed for uprooted residents to be allowed to return to their homes as Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi met.      UN demands Houthis stop ship attacks      On the ground in Gaza, the fighting appeared as intense as ever. Israeli strikes in southern and central Gaza intensified on Wednesday despite a pledge by Israel that it would pull out some troops and shift to a more targeted campaign, and pleading from its ally Washington to reduce civilian casualties.      Israel's chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing late on Wednesday that the military was focusing its operations on Khan Younis and the refugee camps in the centre of the strip.      In the latest sign of the three-month-old war spreading, U.S. and British warships in the Red Sea fended off the biggest attack yet from Yemen's Houthi movement, which says it is acting to support Gaza. Washington and London said they shot down 21 drones and missiles aimed at shipping lanes. No one was hurt.      The UN Security Council late Wednesday approved a resolution demanding the Houthis immediately cease the shipping attacks.      Israel had said this week it was planning to begin drawing down troops, at least from the northern part of Gaza, after weeks of US pressure to scale down its operations and shift to what Washington says should be a more targeted campaign.      The World Health Organization cancelled a planned medical aid mission to Gaza due to security concerns, the sixth such cancellation in two weeks.      The Palestinian Red Crescent said four of its staffers were killed when their ambulance was hit by an Israeli strike on the main road near Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. Two passengers in the ambulance were wounded and later died.      Palestinian health officials at Abu Youssef An-Najar Hospital in Rafah, said four Palestinian children were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Rafah.      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his fourth trip to the region since the war began, went to Ramallah in the Israeli occupied West Bank on Wednesday and met Palestinian leaders, including Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.      The State Department said Blinken expressed support for a Palestinian state and discussed efforts to protect and aid civilians in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority said Abbas told Blinken no Palestinians should be displaced from Gaza or the West Bank.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/israel-face-gaza-genocide-charges-world-court/,Negative,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-10 20:40:06,Davos 2024: Global elite to gather against WEF's most complex backdrop so far,"  NEW YORK, USA - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, French President Emmanuel Macron, and key Middle East leaders are slated to attend next week's  World Economic Forum (WEF) , putting talks to end wars in Gaza and Ukraine at the top of the agenda for the global elite.      The 54th annual WEF gathering in the Swiss ski resort of Davos will occur against its most complicated geopolitical backdrop to date, its president Borge Brende said on Tuesday, January 9.      A challenging global economic picture, with  shifting interest rate policies  and rising debt, will also confront the central bankers, financiers, and business leaders attending.      A key closed-door session addressing this will be led by the chief executives at British-based bank Barclays and Canadian life insurer Manulife Financial Corporation, according to a copy of the agenda obtained by Reuters.      Brende said much of this year's focus would be high-level diplomatic talks on wars in the Middle East, Ukraine, and Africa.      ""We will make sure that we bring together the right people…to see how we can solve this very challenging world.""      Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan would both attend, organizers said, making them the highest profile members of US President Joe Biden's administration in Davos.      A White House official said Sullivan was expected to make a speech and that Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, would also attend. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Blinken and Sullivan will join key stakeholders in the conflict in Gaza, including leaders of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - both countries having emerged as Middle East powerbrokers - and Israel's President Isaac Herzog in Davos.      United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and more than 40 foreign ministers will also be on site, organizers said.      Macron is expected to make a speech about France's role in the future of Europe, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will also address the forum, organizers said. The Elysee French presidential palace did not immediately comment.      War in Ukraine has dominated the last two WEF meetings and while President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is again expected to make a speech, it was unclear if any Russian officials would attend.      China, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, will be sending Premier Li Qiang, the most senior Chinese official to rub shoulders with global business and political leaders at Davos since President Xi Jinping attended in 2017.      WEF organizers also emphasized the attendance of key leaders from the Global South. The non-aligned group of Asian African and Latin American countries have largely stuck to the sidelines over the Ukraine war, after initially condemning Moscow.      Geopolitical risks have mounted around the globe in recent years, with Russia's war in Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas militants, and the recent  related impact on shipping in the Red Sea . China, meanwhile, has been increasing military pressure to assert sovereignty claims over Taiwan.      ""Unfortunately, what the last couple of years has shown us with the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and several other crises around the world is that we were not that resilient,"" said Bob Sternfels, global managing partner, McKinsey & Company, referring to global cooperation in a briefing ahead of Davos.      ""Without resilience, we can have real setbacks.""      ‘Complicated'      A complicated economic backdrop, including central bank policy and increasing debt, would also dominate the agenda, WEF managing director Jeremy Jurgens said.      ""We are expecting 2.9% growth this year and at least the global economy is growing, but it could be doing better.""      Jurgens said that the two regions that stood out for increased participation this year were Latin America and Asia, reflecting ""broader shifts in the global economy.""      Argentina's newly elected President Javier Milei is expected to attend.      A WEF official said 530 banking, insurance, investing, and other finance executives are expected at the meeting.      One key event is the January 17 closed-door Financial Services Governors Meeting, which will be attended by more than 100 chairmen and chief executives from banking, markets, insurance, and asset management, an agenda obtained by Reuters showed.      Barclays CEO CS Venkatakrishnan and Manulife CEO Roy Gori will be co-chairs of the meeting, which will focus on navigating risk against a backdrop of geopolitical tension, macroeconomic uncertainty, and technological disruption.      WEF organizers did not comment on the Governors Meeting.      Davos comes as companies face a complex backdrop of mediocre global growth while economies grapple with high interest rates, political risk, and the after-effects of the pandemic.      ""With matters such as ongoing geopolitical tensions, the urgent need to address climate change, economic concerns, and rapid technological advancements influencing policy and boardroom decisions, this summit will be pivotal,"" Deloitte global chair Anna Marks said in emailed comments.      To some, 2024 shows a return to focusing on the long term.      Karen Harris, managing director of the Macro Trends Group at Bain & Company, said recent WEF annual meetings were shaped by the pandemic, with 2021's being virtual and 2022's delayed.      ""At 2023's forum we were still feeling the disruptions of all of those events, and discussion was centered on the economic recovery,"" Harris said in emailed remarks.      ""This is the first WEF in years during which our sights can really be on what the next decade will bring, rather than the compressed and volatile business cycle.""  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/global-elite-gather-complex-backdrop-davos-world-economic-forum-2024/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2024-01-10 19:40:29,How an election-packed 2024 could swing world markets,"  LONDON, United Kingdom - Countries making up over 60% of the world's economic output and more than half of its population hold elections this year.      Markets face a ""ballot box bombshell,"" financial services group Morningstar says, adding ""prior experience of this kind of event risk shows big changes can cause sell-offs.""      Here's a look at the elections that matter for markets, in roughly chronological order for the coming year.      Taiwan       Date:  January 13       Back story:       Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is competing mainly with the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for the presidency and legislature.      A DPP win would be the third consecutive victory for a party China calls separatist, potentially fueling  Beijing's determination to control Taiwan . The KMT traditionally favors closer ties with China but denies being pro-Beijing.       Market risks:       Taiwan is the main flashpoint in US-China tensions. Investors, fearing  sharpened trade tariffs , have slashed China allocations.      A full-blown Chinese invasion of Taiwan, while seen as unlikely in 2024, would be a potentially catastrophic risk to global markets, including potentially halting advanced chip-making and wiping $1 trillion off annual global economic output, US officials said.      Europe       Dates:  March 10 (Portugal), June 9 (Belgium), June 6 to 9 (European Parliament), autumn/winter (Croatia), November (Romania), to be confirmed (Austria)       Back story:       November's shock win for Geert Wilders's Freedom Party in the Netherlands galvanized the Eurosceptic far-right. Its namesake leads Austria's polls. Portugal's Chega party's vote may double, though left parties lead there.      Crucially, far-right parties eye gains in the European Union's legislature, vowing to toughen migration policy and soften green reforms.       Market risks:       Italian stocks and bonds, Europe's top 2023 performers, may suffer if gains for eurosceptic parties are seen as weakening the commitment to European integration.      The EU raising joint debt to back the post-pandemic recovery has helped reduce the perceived riskiness of Italian debt.      With the EU parliament heavily involved in legislation and electing the next head of the bloc's executive, watch the readout on further support for Ukraine and climate policy.      Russia       Date:  March 17       Back story:       Vladimir Putin, who was handed the presidency by Boris Yeltsin on the last day of 1999, is certain to win another six years in power. Polling shows Putin enjoys approval ratings of above 80% in Russia. Opposition politicians say the election is a carefully stage-managed imitation of democracy.       Key market risk:       In the campaign, Putin may reveal more of his thinking about the war in Ukraine. Putin has warned the West any attempts to meddle in the election will be considered an act of aggression.      Western governments such as the United States and Japan are considering seizing frozen Russian assets such as cash and government bonds held by its central bank overseas. Russia has said it will retaliate if that happens.      Russia's economy has been boosted by massive increases in defense spending on the war, though stubborn inflation fanned by a sharp rouble depreciation has forced interest rates higher.        India       Date:  April-May, TBC       Back story:       Narendra Modi is expected to win a third term as prime minister leading the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in national elections. Investors moving cash out of China have turned to India.       Key market risk:       Persistent inflation could hurt the BJP. Modi would need to form a coalition if it doesn't win an outright majority.      Key commodity exporter India has roiled markets by restricting rice, wheat, and sugar exports. A shift back to fiscal populism risks pushing up India's fiscal deficit which would need funding from potentially record high domestic market borrowing.      Mexico       Date:  June 2       Back story:       Presidential election will involve a full Congress reshuffle and nine state elections. Polls give incumbent National Regeneration Movement (Morena) party and its candidate, ex-Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a wide double-digit lead.      A more balanced Congress preventing constitutional changes from populist Morena is anticipated. But given the success of current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's spending drives, Sheinbaum is expected to follow suit.       Key market risk:       Heftier spending could pull down Mexico's peso and hurt government bonds.      South Africa       Date:  May-August 2024 (TBC)       Back story:       The ruling African National Congress (ANC) risks losing its parliamentary majority in elections for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994.      Economic turmoil, power cuts, austerity, and graft allegations have alienated voters. The ANC may need to partner with the Democratic Alliance or the Marxist Economic Freedom.       Key market risk:       Pre-election, the government could ease austerity, pushing up debt. If the ANC allies with a leftist party, social spending could rise. Worries about a weak currency and public finances could slow down rate cuts.      United States       Date:  November 5       Back story:       Donald Trump is predicted to win the Republican nomination in primaries in the coming months, setting the stage for a tight battle with Democrat incumbent Joe Biden - a rerun of the 2020 election that ended with a pro-Trump mob storming Congress in an attempt to block certification of Biden's victory.      Trump now faces criminal trials in four jurisdictions and an array of other legal cases, while he still claims falsely that the 2020 election was stolen. Biden calls his opponent a threat to democracy who would seek vengeance on his many foes if he regains power.       Market risks:       Markets shrugged off the violence that followed the election four years ago. But given the heated rhetoric on both sides this time around, a Trump-Biden rematch could still worry investors over the risk of social unrest.      A bitter election could affect consumer sentiment as the world's biggest economy seeks to avert a recession from the lagged effects of  aggressive interest rate rises .      The dollar could swing on election probabilities.      Stocks could be hurt by caution over US-China tensions if the parties harness the popularity of trade barriers, with analysts saying higher tariffs would fuel inflation, force up the dollar, and hurt the yuan, euro, and Mexican peso.      Spending cut pledges by either party could upend a complex but popular US bonds trade that wagers government borrowing will increase. And watch oil: Trump favors more US drilling, which Biden has reined in.      Britain       Date:  due by January 2025, expected by end-2024       Back story:       The opposition Labour party under center-left candidate Keir Starmer leads the ruling Conservatives in the polls.       Market risks:       Pre-election, a stagnant economy and tight fiscal budget mean government bonds could be unsettled by any surprise spending promises. A March 6 budget might well contain new tax cuts.      Labour plans to loosen planning rules, in a risk for housebuilders, and make targeted changes to tax rules which could hurt energy companies. It also wants closer relations with the European Union following Brexit, which could boost sterling.      Venezuela       Date:  2024 TBC       Back story:       Incumbent Nicolas Maduro has an advantage in presidential elections, with main opposition candidate Maria Corina Machado banned from participating due to alleged crimes such as supporting US sanctions on Maduro's government and backing former opposition leader Juan Guaido.       Key market risk:       In October, the US lifted oil sanctions for six months and debt sanctions indefinitely, allowing US investors to trade in some bonds in exchange for talks to ensure fair and free elections.      Reinstated sanctions could shake Venezuelan stocks and bonds. Pricing deeply distressed, bonds more than doubled after sanctions were lifted. A possible debt restructuring is also in focus.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/impact-elections-world-markets-2024/,Neutral,['stocks' 'insurance' 'credit cards']
2024-01-10 12:00:38,The psychology of New Year's resolutions,"  2024 is finally upon us, after a year that felt surreal in many ways. The new year brings an innate desire for change and improvement, and the chance to start anew.      Hello,  I'm Natashya Gutierrez , president of Rappler. I first joined Rappler over a decade ago, as part of the newsroom's  first dozen employees . I started off as a multimedia reporter, and later became Rappler Indonesia's bureau chief and Southeast Asia correspondent. I left in 2018 to join VICE as its Asia-Pacific editor-in-chief, ultimately returning to Rappler in October last year.       At university, I was a psychology major and I have always been fascinated by the way the human mind works.  Research  shows that humans across all cultures use ""temporal milestones"" when they want to turn a fresh page - whether it's the start of a semester, or a new week (which is why so many of us start diets on a Monday...) or perhaps a momentous life event like a birthday. But there is no clearer temporal milestone than the New Year.       Behavioral scientists call this  ""the fresh start effect ,"" when a marker in time makes us feel we can mentally wipe the slate clean, and can separate our past selves from our future, aspirational version of ourselves.       Enter New Year's resolutions.       One  study  followed 200 New Year's resolvers and found that resolutions largely revolved around weight loss and changing bad habits like smoking, but it also included aspirations like improving relationships. Results showed that one week into the new year, 77% of participants had maintained their resolutions, 55% after one month, 43% after three months, 40% after six months, and just 19% after two years.       In an  interview, Dr. Tim Kurz , a senior lecturer in social psychology from the School of Psychological Science at the University of Western Australia, shares advice on what makes resolutions stick. Some of them include creating goals that are beneficial to others rather than individualistic goals (so you are not only letting yourself down but others too if you falter); focusing on ""approach goals"" or things you will do, rather than ""avoid goals"" or things you'll stop doing; and making sure the goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based.      I've kept this in mind when crafting my own personal resolutions for 2024, and it's also the same mindset we've taken as we created our own resolutions at Rappler.       For us, 2024 is a significant temporal milestone. It's the year we want to refocus our priorities to what matters the most: amplifying innovation and experimentation, expanding our investigative reporting, and best serving our communities: you.      Our North Star      It has been 12 years since the first dozen of us launched the Rappler website in 2012.       In the last few months, I've sat down and spoken to as many Rapplers as I can, some old employees and lots of new faces, from our reporters to our finance managers to our sales teams. What I've learned is that it's a different organization from the one I left in 2018, having been through relentless press freedom attacks and fighting for survival, but in some ways is still the same - its core values intact, its overarching goal of doing good, unchanged.       I've worked closely with our leadership team to rethink Rappler's purpose and mission, presented it to the whole organization for feedback and comments, and together, carved out our next steps.       I'm excited to unveil our new mission statement, our North Star, as we enter the New Year. It's one we worked on together, as a company, and one we are proud of.       For 2024 and beyond, this is our goal:  To empower changemakers with impactful journalism and meaningful innovation.       We define changemakers as those who want to positively impact their communities - whether they are policymakers or leaders, or young people who stand up for what's right. We want our reporting to inspire action and to hold power to account. And we want to use technology and implement ideas with purpose.       These are all things we've valued and have been doing, but in 2024 and beyond, we want to do more of it. To achieve this, we've taken Dr. Kurz's advice: We've set quarterly goals and internal metrics, understanding that the longer term goals will take time, and we've set clear action plans on how to get there.       And we've started strong.       A few weeks ago, we launched  Rappler Communities  in our revamped Rappler app to give us all a space where we can have healthy online discussions without being attacked. (Do download it on  iOS  or   Android  if you haven't already!) We've released some valuable reporting locally including this exclusive on  an abduction linked to a military agent , and on international affairs, like this  in-depth profile  on Indonesian President Joko Widodo's millennial son Gibran Rakabuming Raka, who could become the new vice president.       Internally, we are dedicated to making Rappler a fun place to work, a healthy environment that is rich with support, purpose, and joy. We also have some projects and events in store that we cannot wait to share with you in the coming months.      Our mission statement is a lofty aspiration and it will be an arduous journey to get there, one that we cannot do alone. We want to continually hear from you, our audience, our partners, the changemakers of our time, and know how we can best continue to work with and serve you. My email is open to all types of feedback and communication at  natashya.gutierrez@rappler.com  - even your personal New Year resolutions.      May we all seize the fresh start effect, be part of that elusive 19% of successful New Year's resolvers two years from now, and ultimately become better versions of ourselves.       Happy 2024, changemakers. The more of us who can stick to our New Year's resolutions, the better our world will be.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/voices/newsletters/psychology-new-years-resolutions/,Neutral,['retirement' '' '']
2024-01-09 18:34:26,FACT CHECK: ‘Promo sale' of premium luggage at Changi airport is a scam - police,"   Claim : As part of its 125th anniversary, luggage brand Rimowa is collaborating with iShopChangi Singapore to sell its suitcases for only S$4 to the first 1,000 online buyers.      Rating: FALSE       Why we fact-checked this : The posts promoting the supposed collaboration appear legitimate as they come from Facebook pages that impersonate iShopChangi, Changi Airport's online duty-free shopping platform, using the company's logo as their profile picture.      The pages also have a sizeable following, with one having 20,000 likes and followers.      One of the posts shows a photo of a silver Rimowa suitcase surrounded by cardboard boxes with the Rimowa logo. The text overlay on the photo reads ""SPECIAL PRICE $4 | Hybrid Collection."" The post caption says that only the first 1,000 suitcases can be redeemed at the S$4 ""special price"" until December 20, 2023. It also included a shortened URL for interested buyers to click on.                  The facts : The Singapore Police Force (SPF)  announced  on December 28 that iShopChangi and Rimowa are not collaborating, and the promotional offer is not real.      Those who clicked on the Facebook advertisement or post were redirected to phishing websites that required their contact information and debit or credit card details to pay for the luggage. They would only realize they have been scammed after unauthorized transactions have been made, the SPF said. (READ:  Phishing 101: How to spot and avoid phishing )      At least 19 people had fallen victim to the phishing scam and lost at least S$7,000 in total in December 2023, the police added.      Additionally, this scam comes on the heels of a  similar luggage scam , where 14 victims had lost at least S$799 in total to scammers pretending to be ""Singapore Airlines Travel"" or ""Singapore Changi.""       Official advisory:  On December 29, the official iShopChangi Facebook page put out a  post  alerting the public about the fake Facebook pages.      ""These advertisements and posts are not legitimate, and we would like to advise members of public not to fall prey and to exercise caution when revealing sensitive data to unverified sources,"" the post read.

2024-01-09 17:22:43,FACT CHECK: No discount codes for Dior bags at Ayala Center Cebu,"   Claim : Ayala Center Cebu is currently offering 66% discount codes for Lady Dior My ABCDior bags. Interested buyers can purchase the products through a link to Dior's online store provided in a Facebook post.       Rating : FALSE       Why we fact-checked this : A Facebook post containing the claim has garnered 830 reactions, 170 comments, and 94 shares as of writing. Based on the comments in the post, some individuals believe the promotional sale is legitimate.      Several users have tagged their Facebook friends and contacts, presumably to make them aware of the promo. There are also comments from suspicious dummy accounts, which seem to be from foreigners, mentioning other contacts.      The post is styled as an apology letter from Ayala Center Cebu for a supposed ""overload phenomenon"" at its Dior store, where customers allegedly queued for two hours but were unable to avail themselves of the promo.      The post claims that the discount codes for the Dior bags may be redeemed by 300 customers. It also included a link to the purported Dior online shop, along with photos of the Dior store at Ayala Center Cebu and the discounted bag priced at P4,599.      The program is supposedly applicable throughout Malaysia until January 12.                  The facts : Jeanette Japzon, corporate communications and digital manager at Ayala Land Inc., confirmed to Rappler in a text message that the announcement for the supposed promotion did not come from Ayala Center Cebu.       Fake page : The misleading post came from a fake account posing as the Ayala Center Cebu shopping mall.      The fake account only has 55 likes and 70 followers, whereas the  official Ayala Center Cebu Facebook page  has 294,000 likes and 305,000 followers. The official page also contains a link to the  Ayala Malls website .       Japzon said they have already reported the fake page to Meta, Facebook's parent company.        Dubious details:  The Facebook post advertising the supposed sale also contains several dubious details. While it claims the promotion was posted by Ayala Center Cebu and included photos of the Dior bag priced in Philippine pesos, it said that the sale was applicable in Malaysia, not the Philippines.       The supposed link to the online store does not lead to the  official Dior website  but to a different page that slightly altered the website address to make it look legitimate. The order page asks for sensitive information, likely as a phishing attempt. (READ:  Phishing 101: How to spot and avoid phishing )      It is also highly unlikely that the discounted bag retails for only P4,599. In the US store, the  price  for the small Lady Dior My ABCDior bag starts at $6,000 (around P334,000).

2024-01-08 18:22:19,Paying taxes now easier under new law. Here's what to expect.,"  MANILA, Philippines- Paying taxes is often burdensome for both individuals and businesses, mainly because of complicated forms to fill out, long lines, and confusing provisions.      But under  Republic Act No. 11976  recently signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., aptly called the Ease of Paying Taxes Act, processes are expected to be streamlined in a bid to encourage people to pay up and increase government revenues.      Here are some of the salient features:       Going digital       Filing of returns and payment of internal revenue taxes will also be made easier through electronic or manual means such as banks or software providers.      This means that even though the taxpayer is not in the Philippines, they can still pay through electronic means. The new law also ensures the availability of registration facilities to non-Philippine resident taxpayers. This provision may also benefit non-residents who are interested to invest in the country.      The option to pay internal revenue taxes to the city or municipal treasurer with jurisdiction over the taxpayer was removed to encourage the shift to electronic payment channels.      The number of income tax return pages will be reduced from four to two pages only.      The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is tasked to assist taxpayers by streamlining tax processes, reducing documentary requirements, and digitalizing its services.       A new classification system       Taxpayers will be classified as micro, small, medium, or large, based on the taxpayer's gross sales.         Micro- less than P3 million      Small- P3 million to less than P20 million      Medium- P20 million to P1 billion      Large- P1 billion and above        Each classification will have its own tax system that is ""responsive and specific to each segment's needs.""       Uniform documentation       The law also sets a uniform documentation for value added tax (VAT) purposes. A VAT invoice will be the sole proof needed for both sale of goods and services.      This move eliminates the need for a reconciliation on sales of services per VAT and income tax purposes.       For long term contracts, the invoice will be issued during the month in which the sale or service has been rendered or supplied.      The mandatory issuance of receipts for each sale and transfer of goods and services is increased from P100 to P500.       VAT refund       The VAT refunds will be classified into low, medium, and high-risk claims.       The classification will be made according to the amount of VAT refund claim, tax compliance history, and frequency of filing of VAT refund claims.      An invoice system will be implemented to accelerate VAT refunds.      The law also provides a 180-day period for the BIR to process general refund claims on erroneous or illegally collected taxes.

Veto      Marcos, however, vetoed the provision which was supposed to exempt micro taxpayers from withholding creditable income tax, as it could impact the government's cash flows.       The Department of Finance noted that creditable withholding taxes serve as advance payment of tax obligations and an audit trail for compliance.      ""We have to strike a balance between providing relief to taxpayers, on the one hand, and maintaining administrative efficiency through the integrity of our tax collection and monitoring mechanisms, on the other,"" Marcos said. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-expect-ease-paying-taxes-law/,Positive,['stocks' 'mortgage' '']
2024-01-08 08:00:07,Philippines' China-backed power grid operator faces perfect storm... and new investor?,"              MANILA, Philippines - An island-wide blackout, a public scolding from no less than the President, and a magnified lens over its Chinese owners and profits - these are the makings of the perfect storm for the company behind the Philippines' power grid operator.      In the wake of all these issues that the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) is facing, the President's cousin, Speaker Martin Romualdez, is making a bold proposal for Marcos's controversial wealth fund to invest into the company.        Strike two       President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. already called out NGCP twice, with the latest one being the most scathing.      In a video message on Friday, January 5, Marcos blamed NGCP for the  massive outage  in Western Visayas, causing ""significant hardship"" in businesses and healthcare.      ""Accountability lies with the NGCP. They are tasked with grid stability. Stability involves proactive responses to breakdowns and unexpected events, a duty that NGCP unfortunately has not fulfilled adequately,"" Marcos said.                   Play  Video                     Marcos first made known his disappointment with NGCP last July 2023, during his second  State of the Nation Address .      Marcos said NGCP had failed to implement 68 grid connections, citing data from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). This effectively resulted in unstable power supply in Luzon and Visayas, especially during peak demand during the summer.      Marcos added that he looks forward to seeing the private grid operator ""complete all of its deliverables,"" starting with the Mindanao-Visayas and Cebu-Negros-Panay interconnections.       By the numbers        Economic losses.  Iloilo Mayor Jerry Trenas expressed his  disappointment over the power interruptions , saying the blackouts have cost his city alone at least P400 million to P500 million in economic losses.      Prior to the January 2, 2024 incident, blackouts occurred back in April 2023.      Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla said the blackouts in Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan, and Antique were preventable.      Lotilla said NGCP failed to act on the power disturbance due to the trip offs of the Panay Energy Development Corporation (PEDC) Units 1 and 2 and the Palm Concepcion Power Corp. (PCPC) Unit 1.      Meanwhile, the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines, the company which facilitates electricity trade in the country, said there was a two-hour window when the NGCP could have proactively called on the distribution utilities and electric cooperatives to reduce their load to prevent a collapse.      Marcos has directed the ERC to reset NGCP's rates without further delay.      The NGCP insisted that it immediately fixed the transmission system and normalized voltage before several power plants ""inexplicably tripped"" on Tuesday.      ""Rather than using NGCP as a scapegoat, we urge policymakers to be objective in their search for facts and not coddle certain sectors,"" the power grid agency said. (READ:  As power returns to Western Visayas, NGCP claps back at critics )      ""We again reiterate our push for a comprehensive industry-wide approach to resolve the persistent power supply issues on Panay Island and elsewhere in the country,"" NGCP added.       Missed targets.  The recent blackouts add to the NGCP's failures, including the 68 delayed transmission projects - 36 in Luzon, 21 in Visayas, and 11 in Mindanao. These projects have a combined worth of P231 billion, which the NGCP was supposed to have invested in between 2009 and 2019.      The Marcos administration is aiming to electrify 100% of households in the country by 2028.       Profits.  Prior to the outages, the NGCP faced scrutiny over its exorbitant profits. The ERC found that the NGCP earned  more than it should . Preliminary findings of its performance review found that the NGCP should only earn up to P183.5 billion from 2016 to 2022, or an average of P36.7 billion yearly. But it claimed a total of P387.8 billion or an annual average of P77.56 billion.      The ERC is currently  reviewing  the performance and rates of NGCP after it did not conduct a rate reset after 2015.      Meanwhile, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism found that NGCP billed some P2.6 billion worth of  corporate social responsibility projects and publicity expenses  to consumers.       The big picture        China's presence.  The recent blackouts have reignited calls to kick the Chinese investors out of NGCP. Some lawmakers even go as far as calling for grid operations to be nationalized once more.      China's State Grid has a 40% stake in NGCP, which it bagged in 2008 during the Arroyo administration amid a power crisis which impacted government finances.       The 60% is owned by companies of Henry Sy Jr. and Robert Coyiuto Jr., who are among the richest Filipino tycoons.       In a hearing last May 2023, Senate committee energy chair Raffy Tulfo said he told the president that China's presence in the power grid had security risks. He also floated the possibility of canceling NGCP's franchise.

Maharlika Investment Corporation president and CEO Rafael Consing Jr. expressed that he is backing the proposal of  Speaker Martin Romualdez  to invest funds into NGCP.      Amid the four-day blackouts, Romualdez said it would be a ""strategic investment"" to do so.      ""This event has highlighted critical issues in our power infrastructure, impacting numerous businesses, industries, and the daily lives of our citizens,"" Romualdez said.      In a statement released by Malacanang, Consing said that ""through such an investment, Maharlika would become a dedicated partner in tackling the Philippines' complex energy challenges.       ""By working hand-in-hand with NGCP's existing shareholders, Maharlika can leverage its unique financial resources and development expertise to accelerate critical infrastructure upgrades, promote renewable energy integration, and improve overall grid efficiency.""       The Maharlika fund aims to fast-track Marcos' ambitious P8.7-trillion infrastructure push. Based on the  latest list  provided by the National Economic and Development Authority, investing in NGCP is not on the agenda.       ""Transparency and accountability must be paramount throughout the process to ensure efficient use of public funds and maximum benefit for the nation. However, the potential rewards are well-worth the exploration,"" Consing said.      Consing and Romualdez' proposal will have to be approved by the Maharlika board.      Kabataan Party floated the idea of the national government taking over NGCP and opposed the investment of Maharlika.      ""From the onset, the Maharlika Investment Scam gambles the people's funds for investments benefiting cronies and favored companies. Maharlika investing into NGCP, a private grid corporation owned by China and two Filipino billionaires, will only line the pockets of the rich and the powerful amidst its role in the Western Visayas blackouts. Why not directly use people's funds to nationalize NGCP instead?""

2024-01-07 13:05:05,"[OPINION] To make the PUVMP work for the poor, the government needs to spend","  December 31st was the deadline for jeepney operators to consolidate into cooperatives or corporations under the  Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) . The program aims to induce changes that result in vehicles with better emissions standards, more organized and predictable routes, and consistent income for operators. It proposes to do this by first nudging operators to join cooperatives or form corporations. These entities will finance vehicle purchases and updating while exercising monopoly power over certain routes.       In some sense, the program is an acknowledgement that the Philippines at large needs a public ground transportation system - a void which the private sector fills. This is because mass transport exhibits the properties of a natural monopoly, which exists if a single seller can most efficiently service a given market. The average daily commuter does not need to be told that the current system is inefficient. In particular, competition for passengers among multiple jeepneys leads to crowding, overfilling within vehicles, and congestion on major stops and streets. Operators themselves also decry the difficulties of making their boundary and being unable to maintain their vehicles. On both the supply and demand side of this market, there is much improvement to be made.       Why then are both operators and commuters  joining strikes and protests against the PUVMP ? On the consumer side, the worry is that the consolidation of operators into singular entities may disrupt service. Further, due to the eventual monopolization of routes, the costs of commuting might go up as market power allows operators to set prices. Just think of the stretch between Katipunan and the Cubao-Araneta station. This segment of Aurora Boulevard is serviced by possibly dozens of jeepneys each hour. If consolidation reduced the volume of jeepneys with the same amount of passengers, one can imagine long lines, delays, and a worse commute.      On the operator side, the biggest concern is the loss of jobs due to the barriers-to-entry that the program would introduce. These include: the costs of updating existing vehicles, purchasing new vehicles, and the costs of forming and coordinating a cooperative or corporation such as land for the headquarters and barriers to credit. The fact that the government set a ceiling of P80,000 of subsidies per unit despite the updated jeepneys costing  upwards of P1 million does not assuage fears that the program may simply push poorer operators out,  letting well-financed corporations take over.       Despite these problems, I believe that the PUVMP can jumpstart a pro-poor mass transit reform by creating a new kind of Public-Private-Partnership between the government and operator-run cooperatives. Concretely, this means four things. First, the government should shoulder most if not all of  the costs of updating vehicles. Second, the government should finance the fixed costs for the cooperatives including the spaces for their headquarters. Third, it should guarantee some benefits to the operators such as covering their PhilHealth and social security contributions, and immediate inclusion in the 4Ps program. Finally, it should limit its assistance to operator-run cooperatives, whose board members and officers come from the ranks of operators and who regularly rotate, rather than extend assistance to private corporations.      The first two recommendations follow, once again, from the economics of natural monopolies. Subsidies are needed to get natural monopolies to operate since it may be difficult for them to start up. The jeepney operators who are needed to form the co-ops that will service different routes face high fixed costs. However, their reorganization is needed to provide a more efficient mass transit system which in turn means productivity gains from workers who can travel easier, and greater well-being for Filipinos from shorter commutes. By shouldering most of the cooperatives' fixed costs, the government is effectively investing in the potential economic gains from better mass transit - just like the major cities in the advanced industrialized world.                        Must Read                          [ANALYSIS] Rethink PUV modernization, focus on commuters                                                                                         As for the additional benefits such as PhilHealth and the 4Ps, these simply make use of existing programs to make the government a sustained stakeholder in the operations of the cooperatives. As other commentators point out, consolidation, by cooperatives or otherwise, do not mean improvement in service. There has to be some  accountability to commuters' needs . By tying the cooperative's continued financing to the government, taxpayers can have a voice (albeit imperfect) in their operations, allowing for improvements like those that made the  point-to-point bus system a modest success .      As usual, the objection to these proposals is whether the government can afford such measures. After all, they can simply limit the subsidies, allow small, independent operators to fall by the wayside, and leave the transport system to well-financed corporations. However, since monopolies exercise market power, this may mean reduced service quality and higher fares. If the mass transport system can run more efficiently through coordination by cooperatives partially accountable to taxpayers, the system is more likely to avoid the pitfalls of higher prices and lower quality endemic in monopolies. This means that the economic gains of improving mass transit do not have to come at the cost of transit jobs. That is certainly worth at least as much as the  confidential and intelligence funds  that our public officials seem quite fond of.       The PUVMP is an opportunity to overhaul mass transit in the Philippines only if the government puts its money where its mouth is. Otherwise, the program will simply erect barriers that create an opportunity for already well-capitalized corporations at the expense of consumers and smaller operators. Thankfully, the PUVMP can still accommodate changes in its implementation without changing its primary objectives. The choices that the government makes in this respect will ultimately reflect its priorities.  - Rappler.com        Alfredo RM Rosete is an Associate Professor at Central Connecticut State University .

2024-01-05 21:54:16,"China-US cooperation ‘no longer optional but imperative,' for both and the world - Wang Yi","  BEIJING, China - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday, January 5, that the most urgent task for Sino-US relations is to establish a correct understanding and cooperation between the two sides is ""no longer an option but an imperative"" for the world.      Cooperation is the ""most correct choice for China and the United States to get along"", Wang said in a keynote speech at an event to mark the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US.      ""It can be said that China-US cooperation is no longer an option for the two countries and even for the world, but an imperative that must be seriously addressed,"" Wang said.      China hopes that the US will, he said, relax its mindset and ""in an attitude of equality and inclusiveness"" respect the choices made by the Chinese people and China's development path, including when defending its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.      ""We are willing to commit ourselves to building a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship on the basis of mutual respect,"" he said.

""We have no intention of replacing anyone, overriding anyone, and have no intention of seeking hegemony,"" he added.      Wang also said that while both nations were built on different backgrounds, the differences should not lead to confrontation, and that the ""big stick of sanctions"" should not be used at every turn to exercise power or hegemony.      Both sides should continue to make full use of restored and established mechanisms in foreign affairs, economics, finance, commerce, agriculture and other areas to eliminate obstacles in their exchanges, he said.

2024-01-05 15:00:00, [Ask the Tax Whiz] What is an annual tax review?,"  The deadline for the filing of the annual income tax return (ITR) is April 15, 2024. What do I know I am fully tax compliant? What is an annual tax review?       You can undertake an annual tax review (ATR) in order to assess your tax compliance.       The ATR is a proactive measure aimed at preparing for an annual tax audit. It involves reviewing the tax compliance of the taxpayer vis-a-vis the BIR requirements. It will determine any possible tax exposure and its corresponding penalties. On top of verifying the timely filing and submission of tax returns and their attachments, along with prompt payment of taxes due, it will also match the sales and expense declaration from various returns and  reports to assess any underdeclaration or overdeclaration, respectively.      Consequently, ATR facilitates the resolution of tax issues even before the start of a BIR audit thus, reducing potential risks of having a huge deficiency tax assessment.      Will reviewing all documents and checklists prevent us from being audited by the BIR?      No. All taxpayers are possible candidates for audit. But it will help companies prepare for an annual tax audit and investigation of the BIR. As provided under Revenue Memorandum Order Nos. 6-2023 and 8-2023, there are certain types of transactions that are subject to Mandatory and Priority Audit:         Mandatory cases         These are transactions to which an audit is required as a condition precedent for the issuance of tax clearance, processing of claims for tax credit/refund and other cases that may be identified by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as priority targets for audit/investigation. The following shall be covered by this type of Audit:      To be covered by eLAs:        Claims for tax refund  of Excise Tax; or Income Tax (except income tax claims of Job Personnel), including final and creditable income tax withheld      Request for Tax clearance whose gross sales or receipts  for the immediately preceding taxable year exceeds P3 million or whose gross assets upon retirement exceeds P8 million      Cases returned to the investigating offices where the original Group Supervisor (GS)/Revenue Officer (RO) who conducted the audit are no longer available due to transfer of work assignment or separation from service      Cases referred by other IO due to the taxpayer's transfer of business registration  where the taxpayer agreed to have the audit continued by the new IO, provided the covered period is not yet prescribing      One -Time Transactions (ONETT) whose cases resulted to a deficiency tax or Real Property Transactions with findings in the Electronic Certificate Authorizing Registration (eCAR) system      Cases with validated discrepancy notices      Policy cases/industry issues under the directive of the commissioner        To be covered by TVNs:        Persons requesting for tax clearance whose gross sales for the immediately Request for Tax clearance whose gross sales or receipts  for the immediately preceding taxable year is P1 Million but not exceeding  P3 million or whose total assets upon retirement is P3 million but not exceeding P8 million      Claims for value-added tax (VAT) refund      Income tax refund of job order personnel      Claims for refund/tax credit arising from erroneous payment of taxes, including double payment of taxes due to system error/glitch           Priority Cases           Cases which have been electronically selected by the IRIS -Audit module based on the prescribed criteria pursuant to identified  risk that need immediate action.      Audit cases that shall be handled  by the VAT Audit Section (VATAS) and Office Audit Section  of the Assessment Division (AD), and  Large Taxpayers VAT Audit Unit (LTVAU)      Cases manually selected by the regional director/ACIR LTS  but this has to be approved by the CIR        What are the things that we need to take note of in our year-end tax compliance?      Taxpayers should remain vigilant about the impending deadlines in 2024. Below are the year-end requirements they must fulfill to comply with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR):             Aside from compliance with the BIR requirements, businesses also need to secure their barangay clearance as well as their business or mayor's permit. Generally, the deadline for the renewal of business permits is  on January 20.       Do you need assistance on your annual tax compliance? ACG conducts a comprehensive review of your tax requirements and assesses possible tax exposures. Through an annual tax review, we help you fix your tax issues even before the beginning of a BIR audit.

2024-01-05 14:30:22,US readies aid as Japan earthquake death toll nears 100,"  WAJIMA, Japan, January 5 - The United States said on Friday, January 5, it is preparing military logistical support and aid for regions in Japan devastated by an  earthquake  that killed 92 people, devastated remote communities, and forced about 33,000 people to leave their homes.      ""The US is here to support our friend and ally in its earthquake response. Military logistical support, food, and other supplies are being readied,"" US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel posted on social media site X, formerly Twitter.      Japan is in talks with the US about emergency assistance and rejected offers for help from other countries including China for the time being.      ""We are not accepting any personnel or material aid from other countries or regions at the moment given the situation on the ground and the effort that would be required to receive them,"" Japan's top spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi said.      A US official who declined to be named told Reuters the two governments were coordinating on possible assistance from US troops.      About 54,000 US forces personnel are based in Japan, the biggest US military presence abroad, according to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.      ""All of US Forces Japan remain ready to support our Japanese Allies during this difficult time. We are unable to provide specifics on military support operations at this time, but we will provide updates when we have more that we can share,"" the US Forces in Japan said in a statement.      200 people missing      The 7.6 magnitude quake struck western Japan's Noto peninsula on the afternoon of New Year's Day, flattening homes, triggering a tsunami and cutting off remote communities.      As the emergency response moved from rescue to aid and recovery, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said there were offers for help and messages of condolence from governments including Taiwan and China.      The full extent of the damage remains unclear, with rescue teams struggling to reach hard-hit areas due to severed roads and broken infrastructure.      But with more than 200 people still unaccounted for, the disaster is likely the deadliest since 2016 and could be the worst since a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the east coast of Japan in 2011.      The US will provide a $100,000 aid package that includes resources such as blankets, water, and medical supplies, according to a statement released by its embassy in Japan.      US armed forces were deeply involved in disaster relief efforts in the 2011 earthquake, providing over 24,000 personnel with 24 ships and 189 aircraft.      Volunteers such as Aydin Muhammet, who heads a construction company based in Nagoya, are also heading into hard-hit areas to give whatever aid they can provide.      ""You can't turn a blind eye after seeing that…. I felt like I had to go, I just had to do something,"" he said.      Tsunami damage      At least 120 hectares (296 acres) of land also appears to be flooded from a tsunami triggered by the earthquake, according to Japan's land ministry.      ""We still don't have a full picture, and it's likely that the area flooded by the tsunami could spread,"" an unnamed land ministry official said to the daily Asahi newspaper.      A preliminary probe led by researchers at the University of Tokyo estimated that the highest point of the tsunami on the western coast of the peninsula could have reached up to 4.2 meters (14 ft) above normal sea level.      The first wave of the tsunami may have reached the northern-most tip of the Noto peninsula only a minute after the earthquake struck, leaving barely any time for residents to evacuate, the daily Yomiuri said citing an analysis by Tohoku University.      Details of the tsunami had been unclear as the tide gauge stopped emitting data immediately after the initial quake, the report said.      Japan's Coast Guard said it was searching one missing person who was washed away by tsunami in Suzu city, the first known potential casualty from the tsunami so far.      Japan will spend 4.74 billion yen ($32.7 million) from state budget reserves to support those hit by the quake, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters on Friday, according to media reports. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-earthquake-updates-january-5-2024/,Neutral,['retirement' 'loans' 'credit cards']
2024-01-05 12:55:42,[ANALYSIS] Welcoming 2024 with more hope than fear in the stock market,"  Happy New Year! I hope you had a grand time last Christmas season and, like many of those I know, are also starting the year with renewed energy and fresh hope.        In a survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations last December on this subject, results showed that ""96% of Filipinos are welcoming 2024 with more hope than fear.""       You may have come across the said survey. It particularly tried to capture the people's pulse on how hopeful – or fearful - are they for the coming year.        Let me be clear, however, that since the survey was about making a comparative analysis on the outlook of people for the New Year from previous years, the study downplayed the result. It said that the 96% figure was not as impressive as it looks. This is because, as the report described it, this is only ""a point above the 95% (registered) in 2022 and the highest since the pre-pandemic (findings of) 96% in 2019."" As such, this ratio of Filipinos with positive outlook toward the new year improved only slightly.      But if you look back at what last year was to investors in the market and to ordinary people, this 96% ratio of Filipinos with positive outlook toward 2024 is but simply awesome.       2023 market performance      The market's close last year was anti-climactic: while it gave an impression of ending the year with a strong close, the opposite happened. It lost steam just like that and fell lower into negative territory.       As a result, the bourse's main index, the Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc. index or PSEi, stopped in its tracks at 6,450.04 on the last trading day of 2023.      On this last trading of trading, the market even suffered a day's loss of 69.07 points or 1.1%. Consequently, the PSEi ended with a year-to-date (YTD) loss of 116.35 points or 1.77%.      The PSE website also showed that the market churned out a daily average value turnover of P6.09 billion only.  This is comparatively lower by 16.5%  from the P7.30 billion average produced in 2022.        In the same report, foreign investors had a smaller or reduced business transaction record in 2023 - aside from being net sellers for the year.        Foreign investors only had a net selling value turnover of P53.67 billion. This was about P14.38 billion, or 21.13% less than their net transactions of P68.05 billion in 2022.      On the other hand, the bourse had a better story line on capital fund raising. The bourse was able to help companies raise a total amount of P140.95 billion from primary and secondary shares offerings in 2023. This was 27.8% higher than the P110.29 billion that was raised in 2022.      Additionally, the above funds were reportedly raised from the following capital-raising activities: 3 initial public offerings (IPOs), 5 follow on offerings (FOO), 5 stock rights offerings, and 11 private placements.      Lastly, even if the bourse was not able to land on the green by the end of the year, it recorded a slight increase in market capitalization equivalent to 1.10% or P16.74 trillion. This may not be much but this can only mean that some of its component stocks enjoyed better market prices.       Bourse's programs, market forecasts      Ahead of expectations for better economic conditions such as higher GDP growth, lower inflation, and possible reduction in interest rates, the bourse is said to be expecting about 6 fundraising events in 2024. A total of P175.0 billion (US$4.2 billion) is expected to be raised and about P40.0 billion of which would be in the form of IPOs.                       Must Read                          Inflation cools to 3.9% in December 2023 but gov't still fails to meet target                                                                                         One of the companies lined up to raise capital through an IPO is Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation. It's reportedly one of the Philippines' biggest solar power producers in the country.       The company has already filed its documents with regulators. Initial information shows that Citicore plans to sell up to 3.335 billion shares; this includes a mulled amount for over-allotment option. Tentative offer price is P3.88 per share. The purpose of the exercise is to finance capital expenditures.      To boost trading activity, the bourse will push for regulatory reforms that will promote and encourage wider stock market participation and entice foreign investors back to our market, which are found in the bill filed in Congress by Albay 2 nd  District Representative, Joey Sarte Salceda, titled ""Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act."" Among the provisions is to cut the stock transaction tax to 0.1% from 0.6%, and the dividend tax on non-residents to 10% from 25%.      Lastly, market analysts continue to believe that with an inflation rate of 4.0%, the PSEi will possibly hit the 7300 to 7500 of the PSEi in 2024.        Market resistance, on one hand, is estimated at the following levels of the PSEi: 6300 (11.7x PE), 6700 (12.4xPE), 7100 (13.1xPE). On the other hand, market resistance is placed at 5900 (10.9xPE), 5700 (10.6xPE), 5200 (9.6%PE).      These estimates, however, will drastically change for the better - or worse - depending on how existing geopolitical tensions across the globe and/or within the region will pan out in 2024.  - Rappler.com              The article has been prepared for general circulation for the reading public and must not be construed as an offer, or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments whether referred to herein or otherwise.

2024-01-05 12:26:40,"Generative AI's wild 2023: ‘Hallucinate' as word of the year, $27B in investments","  ChatGPT was well on its way to becoming a household name even before 2023 kicked off.      Just weeks after the November 30, 2022 launch of the generative artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, OpenAI, the non-profit behind ChatGPT, was projected to rake in as much as  $1 billion in revenue  in 2024, sources told Reuters at the time.      The so-called large language model's ability to turn prompts into poetry, song, and high school essays enchanted 100 million users within two months, accomplishing what took Facebook four and a half years and Twitter five in becoming the fastest growing consumer app ever.      Sometimes, the answers were wrong, despite being delivered with conviction. This happened often enough that ""hallucinate,"" in the sense of AI producing wrong information, was selected as Dictionary.com's  word of the year , owing to the technology's deep impressions on society.      ""In 2023, we saw dictionary lookups for  hallucinate  increase 46% over the previous year, alongside a comparable increase in the noun form  hallucination ,"" the site said.       Such mistakes did not sap the euphoria or stop the existential dread this new technology inspired. Investors, led by Microsoft's multibillion dollar bet on OpenAI, injected $27 billion into generative AI startups in 2023, according to  Pitchbook .       The battle for AI supremacy, stewing in the background between big tech firms for years, was suddenly in focus with Alphabet, Meta and Amazon.com all announcing new milestones.      By March, thousands of scientists and AI experts, including Elon Musk,  signed an open letter  demanding a pause to training more powerful systems to study their impact on, and potential danger to, humanity. The move drew parallels to ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan's box office hit about the titular atomic bomb maker's warnings that the relentless pursuit of progress could lead to human extinction.      ""This is an existential risk,""  said one of the ""godfathers of AI,""  Geoffrey Hinton, who quit Alphabet in May. ""It's close enough that we ought to be working very hard right now, and putting a lot of resources into figuring out what we can do about it.""      Why it matters      Consultancy PwC estimated AI-related economic impact could reach $15.7 trillion globally by 2030, nearly the gross domestic output of China.      Powering this growth optimism is the fact that nearly every industry from finance and legal to manufacturing and entertainment have embraced AI as part of its foreseeable strategy.      The winners and losers in the AI era are only just emerging. As in other eras, beneficiaries will likely be drawn along socio-economic lines. Civil rights advocates have raised concerns over potential bias in AI in fields such as recruitment, while labor unions have warned of deep disruptions to employment as AI threatens to reduce or eliminate some jobs including writing computer code and drafting entertainment content.      Chipmaker Nvidia, whose graphics processors are the hottest commodity in the global AI race, has emerged as a big early winner, with its market capitalization soaring into the trillion dollar club alongside Apple and Alphabet.      In the final months of the year, another winner appeared unexpectedly out of turmoil. In November, the board of OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman for ""not being consistently candid with them,"" according to its terse statement.                       Must Read                          Business Sense: 2023 is generative AI's breakout year                                                                                         In the absence of explanation, the spectacle became a referendum over AI evangelism, represented on the one hand by Altman's push to commercialize AI, versus skeptics and doomsayers who sought a slower and more careful approach.      The optimists - and Altman - won. The ousted CEO was restored just days later, thanks in no small part to OpenAI employees who threatened a mass exodus without him at the helm.      In explaining what brought the company to the brink, Altman said people were fretting over the high stakes of developing AI that could surpass human intelligence. ""I think that all exploded,"" he said at a New York event in December.      Some OpenAI researchers had warned of a new AI breakthrough ahead of Altman's ouster, through a top-secret model called Q* (pronounced Q-Star), Reuters reported in November.      What does it mean for 2024?      One question provoked by the OpenAI saga: will the future of AI and its societal impact continue to be deliberated behind closed doors, by a privileged few in Silicon Valley?      Regulators led by the EU are determined to play a lead role in 2024 with a comprehensive plan to establish guardrails for the technology in the form of the EU AI Act. The details of the draft are due to be disclosed in the coming weeks.      These rules, and others being drafted in the UK and US, come as the world heads into the biggest election year in history, raising concern about AI-generated misinformation targeting voters. In 2023 alone, NewsGuard, a company which established a ratings system for news and information websites,  tracked 614  ""unreliable"" AI-generated sites in 15 languages from English to Arabic and Chinese.      Good or bad, expect AI, which has already been conscripted to make campaign calls in the US, to play an outsize role in many of the elections taking place this year.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/generative-ai-wild-2023-recap-yearender/,Positive,['stocks' 'retirement' 'insurance']
2024-01-04 20:54:37,Retirement of 2 officials sets off DA leadership reshuffle,"  MANILA, Philippines - The Department of Agriculture (DA) welcomed the new year with a major leadership reshuffle, following the retirement of Undersecretaries Domingo Panganiban and Leocadio Sebastian.      In a radio interview on Thursday, January 4, assistant secretary and spokesperson Arnel de Mesa said Panganiban's term ended on December 31.      Meanwhile, De Mesa said, Undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian was also leaving by the end of January. Sebastian led the DA's rice industry development.      Sebastian was appointed by DA chief Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. as a member of the secretary's Technical Advisory Group through  Special Order No. 1 .      Panganiban, 84, was agriculture chief himself under former presidents Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He returned to the DA as senior undersecretary while President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was concurrent agriculture chief.      Marcos left the post in November last year, when he  appointed  fishing industry tycoon Francisco Tiu Laurel.      In a statement on Thursday, the DA said agriculture chief Tiu Laurel issued special orders for the changes in leadership ""to better harness their talents and vast experience.""      De Mesa clarified in the interview that there were no controversies surrounding Panganiban and Sebastian's retirement.       Sebastian told Rappler that it was a voluntary retirement for his part after 28 years of government service. Sebastian started working in government back in 1983 for the Philippine Tobacco Research and Training Center. From 1968 to 1988, he worked at the National Tobacco Administration, an attached corporation of the DA. He spent the next ten years at the Philippine Rice Research Institute before working abroad. Upon his return to the Philippines, Sebastian returned to government work in 2021.       In the past year, the two undersecretaries have been prominent in congressional hearings regarding issues in price hikes of agricultural products. Panganiban was one of the officials who signed the controversial  Sugar Order No. 6  which authorized the importation of 440,000 metric tons of sugar back in February 2023.       ""Sariling decision po nila, opo …  Na mag-retire na po,""  De Mesa said. (It was their own decision, yes. To retire already.)       ""Ano naman po ito mga- 'yung iba po ay dahil may bago tayong administration so part po 'yun ng mga kortesiya,""  he added.

They keep saying I'm turning to random people to do a new album,"" Spears wrote.      Spears bared that she has no plans of returning to the music industry. She also explained that she has been writing songs for other artists for the past two years, and that she prefers this arrangement.       ""When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people! For those of you who have read my book, there's loads that you don't know about me. I've written over 20 songs for other people the past two years! I'm a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way,"" she continued.       The 42-year-old also went on to clear up the rumors that her memoir,  The Woman in Me,  was published illegally without her consent - stating that she is actually ""loved and blessed.""       In December 2021, the former pop star had also mentioned that she  wasn't ready  to continue making music, as she had begun to fear the industry and the people in it after ""the awful things they have done to me personally and after what I've been through.""       ""Not doing my music anymore is my way of saying 'fuck you' in a sense when it only actually benefits my family by ignoring my real work.

2024-01-03 13:00:00,[Vantage Point] Economic czar ,"  Once in a while - and it's literally far and few between - a few good men willingly join the government to make a positive difference.      I can only name two - Jaime Bautista and lately  Frederick Go . Both men come from the private sector which guarantee them comfortable lives even after retirement.       What drives Bautista and Go to sacrifice their otherwise  peaceful and comfortable lives to endure scorn and contempt from envious career-clinging government people? Both know that they are entering a snake pit, but the motivation to change what they see as fundamentally flawed system overrides any risks and hardship they will face.      We all know the story of Bautista ever since he took the helm of the Department of Transportation (DOTr). On how some people harboring a corrupt system try as they might to ease him out of office. His clean record has been his armor and to this day, has been impenetrable! Go is built of the same mold and we can expect the same brand of service.      In a December 15 executive order, President Ferdinand (Bongbong) Marcos Jr. announced the  creation of the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs  (OSAPIEA), headed by its first-ever secretary, 54-year-old Frederick Go, president and chief executive officer of Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC).       By accepting the position, Go divested all of his substantial business shareholdings to eliminate potential conflicts of interest that would compromise his official decision making. For him, the sacrifice was huge, but necessary, if he were to truly serve the public with utmost responsibility, integrity, efficiency, and loyalty.      While Go's appointment was well-received by foreign and local business groups, the title certainly looks intimidating enough to cause apprehension among some the country's economic managers. Despite their public pronouncements welcoming Go's appointment, not all seem sincere.       One of PBBM's economic managers sees Go as lacking in the fundamentals of economic management and therefore not qualified for the position. Unfortunately for said secretary, news travels fast. Before he knew it, his antipathy reached the ears of many people. This is why I find it utterly hypocritical of him to be effusive in his praise for PBBM's appointment of Go in various media pronouncements.       The chief mandate of OSAPIEA includes supervising and monitoring the National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management, and Department of Trade and Industry, among other agencies.      The heads of these four agencies, the chief of the Presidential Management Staff, and the secretaries of nine other departments make up the Economic Development Group, which is in charge of the major economic policies of the government. This cluster used to be headed by the finance secretary.      One of the concerns raise by some sectors against Go's appointment is duplicity. The functions of the newly created office, they believe, are already being handled by the country's economic managers and that there is no need to create an office to do the job.       This was however shot down by Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) president George Barcelon, who sees Go's office more as an additional channel to relay the issues that the business sector wants to be addressed.      ""I have heard some concerns that it might be an added redundancy. But from what I see, there are really times when the schedule of the president is full because of his many responsibilities. So, it's an added channel of communication for us,"" Barcelon was quoted by the   Philippine Daily Inquirer   as saying.      The Indonesia experiment      Having someone who has the ears of the president is not unique to the Philippines. The economic success of Indonesia can be largely credited to its Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs (Kementerian Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan Investasi), headed by Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan. The office, created by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on October 23, 2019, is tasked to lead the planning, coordinating, as well as synchronizing of policies in maritime affairs and investments.       In four years since its inception, the office has been credited with the rapid economic rise of Indonesia. Recently, Pandjaitan has cemented Indonesia's cooperation with Korea in the field of electronic vehicles and a project to build a new capital of the Southeast Asian country, leveraging Korea's technological expertise and Indonesia's abundant resources.      Pandjaitan also met with US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen in August 2023 to discuss Indonesia's Just Energy Transition Partnership work on the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan. The CIPP will coordinate with partners in allocating the $20 billion in JETP financing towards specific projects and priorities that will support Indonesia's achievement of the ambitious climate targets that its government has set in the November 2022 JETP Joint Statement.      This is the kind of swift action the Philippines needs to spur much-needed economic activities which government planners, tasked with reading economic data, will be hard put at achieving. Robert Young of the export-oriented Foreign Buyers Association of the Philippines also said in the  Inquirer interview  that they support Go's appointment, primarily due to his private sector credentials. ""My take is that all these departments that have been placed under his supervision, nothing is happening to the issues that are being raised to them. So, there is clamor to put a person who will be in charge of them all.""      Ebb Hinchliffe, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines also in a message to the Inquirer said: ""In our interactions with Secretary Go, we were encouraged by his desire to remove roadblocks to investment and doing business. We're hopeful that this will translate into his new role and in the policies that the government's economic cluster will pursue.""       We call him Deck      I first met Go as a 19-year-old newly minted BS Management Engineering graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University. He was endorsed to me by his uncle, the late Robinson's patriarch, John Gokongwei Jr. (Mr. John), for training in the business section of the  Manila Times  which I then headed as editor.       A year prior, Mr. John and I were conceptualizing how he would run  Manila Times  which he had just bought from the Roces family. At the time, I was the assistant business editor of the  Philippine Star.  Mr. John was a good friend and my business mentor, but I turned down his offer for me to be the publisher and editorial board chair of the  Manila Times . I felt that I was too young and inexperienced to handle such a critical position. I gave him some names: the late Johnny Perez and the late Frederick ""Ricky"" Agcaoili, who became the Times publisher and editor-in-chief, respectively. The two then proceeded to fill in the editorial staff, with Mr. John's daughter Robina Pe overseeing the Times' editorial makeup. I settled for the position of business editor, and Mr. John allotted some company shares to me.       The thing I admire most about the Gokongwei Family is how each member had to learn the ropes, starting at the lowest possible job, before being considered for key positions in one of the companies they own.       Deck proved more than up to the task. I assigned him to cover the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the stock market beat where he honed his business writing and news gathering skills to near perfection. In the beat, he befriended government functionaries and business leaders, all the while concealing his family background. Diligent in his assigned task, he worked his butt off, never complaining and always keeping his two feet on the ground.       I left the Times for a more lucrative offer from a foreign business publication, but never lost touch with Mr. John whom I communicated with on a weekly basis. Deck was transferred to a new department where he also excelled.       I wasn't surprised when Mr. John finally assigned Deck to take care of RLC as its president and CEO. In the past three decades, Deck has parlayed RLC into a P223-billion property conglomerate with 53 malls, 28 office buildings and 24 hotels. He was also instrumental in the group's expansion move to the casino business, infrastructure (Luzon International Premier Airport Development Corporation), and banking.      The Gokongweis have never used their prominence or businesses to acquire political influence in furthering their own interests. When Mr. John built the Gokongwei family business in Cebu, he toiled hard and succeeded on his own entrepreneurial and leadership savvy, not on family relations or political influence. He guided each member of his family who now works for a family corporation to use the same work ethic.      Deck Go's position as the President's special adviser is not meant to substitute for the expertise of department heads, all of whom were appointed for their competence. President Marcos Jr. only sought to create the position so that he can have more help in coordinating his key policies and economic priorities.      What Go brings to the table      Joining the government is definitely a huge sacrifice for Go. I could only surmise that the decision is spurred by the business sector's lament that nothing is getting done to fast-track economic progress in the country.  Having led a multibillion-peso company, Go is certainly a plus for the Marcos government. He will bring his vast experience in business to spur economic development. The realms of business and economics after all are intricately connected, with both playing vital roles in shaping the global landscape. While economists analyze and interpret economic phenomena, businessmen actively engage in the practical application of economic principles. Compared to economists who often operate at a more theoretical level, businessmen - with their hands-on approach to economic activities - are better-positioned to drive innovation, create value, and spur economic growth.       Businessmen are at the forefront of innovation and agility, constantly seeking new ways to meet market demands, and stay ahead of the competition. Unlike economists who may rely or focus more on analyzing historical data and formulating theories, businessmen operate in the dynamic and ever-changing business environment. Their ability to identify opportunities, take risks, and innovate in response to market needs allows them to contribute directly to economic progress.      Entrepreneurs possess a unique vision that goes beyond theoretical economic models. While economists may study and predict economic trends, businessmen have a tangible impact on the economy by bringing their visions to life. Successful businessmen often possess a deep understanding of consumer behavior, market dynamics, and emerging trends, enabling them to create products and services that resonate with the public.      Businessmen are instrumental in job creation and wealth generation, which are essential components of a thriving economy. Through the establishment and expansion of businesses, entrepreneurs contribute to employment opportunities, thereby reducing unemployment rates and fostering economic stability. Additionally, successful businesses generate wealth, not only for the entrepreneurs themselves, but also for their employees and stakeholders, thus creating a positive ripple effect throughout society. -  Rappler.com        Val A.

2023-12-31 16:11:35,[Two Pronged] I have no money for therapy. What do I do?,"   Rappler's Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes.        Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives .       Together, they have written two books:  Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality  and  Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.             Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer:          Thank you very much for reading my letter. I've been going     through a hard time lately. I want to see a therapist, but I     don't have enough money for one. Is there anything I can do     to help my mental health even if I'm on a limited budget? Can     you suggest any resources or therapists for people who     don't make a lot of money?           Sincerely, M             Dear M,      Thank you for your email.      Access to mental health support is an issue in many countries. Shortages of therapists, who tend anyway to be found mainly in urban areas, and financial constraints conspire to exacerbate the problem. Even where access to medical facilities is free e.g. the UK, demand tends to outstrip supply and wait times can be extensive.      In the Philippines, there are some limited free sources of therapy and the internet is a good source for these, e.g.  this piece.        In addition, online searches can provide extensive information on a wide variety of mental health issues. There are also excellent videos and podcasts available for free. The proviso of course is, like everything else on the internet, one has to be able to distinguish between information, false information, and disinformation. If you are fortunate enough to have a basic grasp of your problem(s), then you can do your own research into symptoms, causes, treatments etc.      Prescription medicine is often recommended and this can usually be obtained from your own doctor, particularly if you have become knowledgeable enough regarding your illness to be in a position to make a good case for it. A healthy lifestyle - diet, exercise, no smoking/drinking etc. - will help, and many also have faith in homeopathic remedies, particularly those that have withstood the test of time.       With one or a combination of these, hopefully you will enjoy a more healthy and happy 2024.       All the best, JAFBaer                       Must Read                          [Two Pronged] Depression, anxiety, and burnout                                                                                         Dear M:      Thank you so much for your letter and for bringing up a question which many people want answered.        I trained under Dr. Jack Annon, from the University of Hawaii, who started the Plissit Model (of Sex Therapy). While it is true that the model was first formulated as a guideline in the field of sexology, I have used it many times for the many different concerns people come to me with. It saves a lot of time, resources (including finances), and angst for both the client and therapist.         PLISSIT is an acronym to determine the levels of intervention an individual may need to get better.      P stands for   permission   .  Permission giving, if that is really all a person needs; as in being reassured that yes, it is normal to want to ram through the car whose driver cut you off (but not to actually do it). Yes, it is normal to avoid even your best friend when you know you must apologize to them, and in time, one happy sign that you are getting better is actually apologizing.        Often, friends, family, and/or guidance counselors in real life or mental health professionals in call-in radio programs, etc. can help since all that is really needed is someone to provide a non-judgmental space where you can be free to explore different aspects of yourself without embarrassment or fear.       The second level is   limited information.     Again, this is sufficient if that is really all the person needs. For example, specific information that will help deal with your concerns more fully. Is there a sex addicts anonymous here in the Philippines that can help me? (There is.) What are the steps I need to take so I can be more confident in public speaking since this is a requisite for my job?       The third level is   specific suggestions.   Oftentimes, that is all a person needs to alleviate their concerns. Example: Next time you feel scared or angry, try some deep breathing exercises which can help alleviate the fear or anger so you can decide things more rationally; or maybe it's time to say goodbye and drop this so-called boyfriend of yours.       The fourth and final level is   intensive therapy  . This is where Mr. Baer's suggestion of contacting any of the professional services willing to give free therapy would be spot on.       Sometimes there is really no replacement for therapy. Dr. Lissa Rankin wrote the book  Mind Over Medicine: Scientific Proof That You Can Heal Yourself  (2020). I know, I know, it seems ironic that its subtitle emphasizes that  you can heal yourself,  but her words are the best I can find to explain why you may need therapy from a professional:   ""The power of the subconscious mind explains why positive thinking only gets you so far. How many times have you read self-help books, taken workshops, made New Year's resolutions, and vowed to improve your life, only to realize a year later that your life is no better? Since the conscious mind is only functioning 5% of the time, it has little power to overcome the weighty influence of the subconscious mind. To effect lasting changes in belief, you must change your beliefs not just at the level of the conscious mind, but in the subconscious mind.""      I have asked some of my former students at PLM, those who are just a thesis away from getting their MA's in clinical psychology, if they would be willing to give free therapy to clients, on the condition that I would supervise them. These are students who have been trained in class to deal with underlying issues affecting our thoughts and behavior that cannot be noticed at first. Three have said yes and have even committed some time to do this. Please feel free to write us again so I can help you get in touch with one of them.      I sincerely hope we have been able to help you so that, on the eve of 2024, you, we, and every other sentient being can look forward to a healthier, happier new year.

2023-12-31 16:00:00,How House lawmakers flexed their political muscle in 2023,"  MANILA, Philippines - In 2023, the lower chamber bared its teeth to provocateurs, portraying itself as a House ready to bite back at those who dare question the integrity of the institution and its leadership.      Political allies of the Marcos administration hold a supermajority at the House of Representatives and are not afraid to issue warnings or sanctions to those that cross the institution's path.       ""I am prepared to stand before anyone and vehemently defend our actions and decisions, even in the face of issues that threaten our institution's integrity,"" Speaker Martin Romualdez said in his speech during the opening of session on November 6.      This year, the House acknowledged public outrage over the confidential funds mess that hounded Vice President Sara Duterte, an ally of President Ferdinand Marcos, by taking action against her secret funds requests for 2024.      Rappler looks back at key events that gave House members opportunities to flex their political muscle in 2023.      Confidential funds fiasco      Requests for  confidential funds  made headlines during this year's  budget season  amid the proposals of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the Department of Education (DepEd) that asked for P500 million and P150 million, respectively.      Emboldened by the public asking for answers as well, opposition lawmakers  zeroed in  on Vice President Sara Duterte after the OVP was found spending  P125 million in less than two weeks  in 2022.                   Play  Video                     The secret funds were apparently not even granted by Congress to the OVP in 2022.      The Vice President also  failed to specifically explain  how her offices - including the DepEd - will make use of the fund that typically finances intelligence operations. ""Education is intertwined with national security,"" she would later say  in an ambush interview  without elaborating further.      Duterte  resorted to personal attacks  against lawmakers who questioned her P650-million spy funds request: ""I do not respect Ms. Castro and Ms. [Risa] Hontiveros. I have no respect for them.""                   Play  Video                     In the end, the lower chamber did not grant Duterte's confidential funds, instead  reallocating  it to government agencies on the forefront of protecting the West Philippine Sea. Duterte would later  drop the P650-million request  in Senate budget deliberations.      ""The House was never lenient, nor did it favor anyone,"" Romualdez said following the House decision to junk the Vice President's confidential funds request for 2024. ""The entire process was dedicated to uplifting the lives of our fellow citizens and staying true to the fundamental principles of the system of checks and balances in the government.""      Cutting a former president down to size      Following the House decision on the Vice President's confidential funds request, former president Rodrigo Duterte took to a Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI) program to express dismay over how the lower chamber treated his daughter's confidential fund request. His sermon claimed that the House - an institution he was part of from 1998 to 2001 - was the ""most rotten"" in the Philippine government and even  threatened to kill Castro .      Rodrigo also blamed the alleged 2028 political aspirations of Romualdez for the decision to strip the OVP and DepEd of confidential funds, which the Speaker  had denied .                   Play  Video                     What happened next came as a surprise for many: Political party leaders of the lower chamber teamed up to  call out  the former chief executive. House Secretary General Reginald Velasco also  set the record straight  on claims that corruption is rampant at the chamber.      House members - even if they tried to not name Rodrigo during plenary - passed a resolution to "" uphold the integrity "" of the chamber and pledged continued support for its leadership once session reopened. Rodrigo's known political allies also  lost key positions  after failing to sign the resolution, which was backed by the entire House leadership.      The shift in Rodrigo's political influence then triggered an exodus of lawmakers from Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), moving to Romualdez-led Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD).      Probing a fake news network      SMNI is not exactly ending the year on a high note.      In December, the network was slapped with suspensions from the  Movie and Television Review and Classification Board  (MTRCB) and the  National Telecommunications Commission  (NTC).      This all started because the lower chamber started an  investigation into the false report  about the travel spending of Romualdez in late November.  Laban Kasama ng Bayan  hosts  Jeffrey ""Ka Eric"" Celiz  and  Lorraine Badoy  discussed on live television an unconfirmed report that the speaker supposedly spent P1.8 billion on official travel this year, when the Office of the House Speaker  spent only P4.347 million .                       Must Read                          Quiboloy's SMNI fuels disinformation, online attacks on gov't critics                                                                                         Both Celiz and Badoy were  cited in contempt  by lawmakers after they refused to answer questions during a House probe.      ""To SMNI right now, again [you're on] very, very thin ice,"" Deputy Majority Leader David Suarez warned on December 5. Celiz and Badoy refused to name their Senate source during the investigation, repeatedly citing the Sotto law that protects journalists from the investigation, and the hours-long probe annoyed lawmakers.      The two, however, were released a week later right before the holidays over "" humanitarian considerations .""      SMNI's fate remains up in the air. Although clear violations were brought to light due to the House probe, some have raised concern over how it might set a dangerous precedent.

2023-12-30 11:00:00,Sam Bankman-Fried will not face a second trial,"  NEW YORK, USA - US prosecutors said they do not plan to conduct a second trial against Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted last month of stealing from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange.      In a letter filed on Friday night, December 29, in federal court in Manhattan, prosecutors said the ""strong public interest"" in a prompt resolution of their case against the 31-year-old former billionaire outweighed the benefits of a second trial.      Prosecutors said that interest ""weighs particularly heavily here,"" given that Bankman-Fried's scheduled March 28, 2024, sentencing will likely include orders of forfeiture and restitution for victims of his crimes.      Jurors on November 2 convicted Bankman-Fried on all seven  fraud and conspiracy counts he faced . Prosecutors had accused him of looting $8 billion from FTX customers out of sheer greed.      Lawyers for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.      Bankman-Fried had faced six additional charges that had been severed from his first trial, including campaign finance violations, conspiracy to commit bribery, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.      He had been extradited in December 2022 from the Bahamas, where FTX was based, to face the seven earlier charges.      The Bahamas has yet to grant its consent for a trial on the remaining charges, however, leaving the timetable uncertain, prosecutors said.      Bankman-Fried's verdict came nearly one year after FTX filed for bankruptcy, erasing his once-$26 billion personal fortune in one of the fastest collapses of a major participant in U.S. financial markets.      Bankman-Fried could face decades in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan.      Prosecutors said much of the evidence that could be offered at a second trial was already presented at the first trial.      They also said a second trial would not affect how much time Bankman-Fried could face in prison under recommended federal guidelines, because Kaplan could consider all of Bankman-Fried's conduct when sentencing him for the counts on which he was convicted.      Bankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.      He testified at trial that he made mistakes running FTX, including by not creating a team to oversee risk management, but did not steal customer funds.      Bankman-Fried also said he thought the borrowing of money from FTX by his crypto-focused hedge fund Alameda Research was permissible, and that he did not realize how precarious their finances had become until shortly before both collapsed.      The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate has been jailed since August, when Kaplan revoked his bail after concluding that Bankman-Fried had likely tampered with prospective trial witnesses.      The case is U.S. v.

2023-12-29 19:37:06,Kremlin says it has list of Western assets to be seized if Russian assets are confiscated,"  MOSCOW, Russia - The Kremlin on Friday, December 29, warned the West that it had a list of US, European and other assets that would be seized if G7 leaders decided to go ahead and confiscate $300 billion in frozen Russian central bank reserves.      Leaders of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations will discuss a new legal theory that would enable the seizure of frozen Russian assets when they meet in February, two sources familiar with the plans and a British official said on Thursday, December 28.      Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any such move by the West would amount to ""theft,"" violate international law and undermine reserve currencies, the global financial system and the world economy.      ""It will be a significant blow to the main parameters of the international economy, it will undermine the international economy,"" Peskov told reporters.      ""It will undermine the confidence of other countries in the United States as well as in the EU as economic guarantors. Therefore, such actions are fraught with very, very serious consequences.""      When asked if there was a specific list of Western assets that Russia could seize in retaliation, Peskov said: ""Yes. There is.""      He declined to say which specific assets were on the list.      After President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry, blocking around $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets in the West.      US and UK officials have worked in recent months to jumpstart efforts to confiscate Russian assets immobilized in Belgium and other European cities, and hope G7 leaders agree to issue a stronger statement when they meet in late February, around the second anniversary of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, three sources told Reuters.      Confiscation?      The legality of confiscating Russian sovereign assets is not clear cut – and Russia has repeatedly said it would contest any seizures in the courts.      Supporters of seizing Russian assets say that the war in Ukraine is an illegal war and that the frozen Russian money should be given to Ukraine either for reconstruction or even to fight Russian forces.      Russian officials, though, say that the West has fought several wars of doubtful legality including the 2003-2011 US-led war in Iraq - and some lawyers have questioned if confiscation is even legal in international law.      No decisions had been made, and several countries – including the United States and Britain – would require legislative changes to establish the needed authorities to carry out such seizures, sources told Reuters.      Russia has reduced holdings of US Treasuries since 2014 and some in the United States have warned that confiscating Russian assets could prompt other major powers - including China - to shun US and European currencies and government bonds.      Though the Russian central bank has not detailed exactly which assets have been frozen, most of the bonds and deposits are denominated in euros as well as some in US dollars and British pounds, according to publicly available data detailing holdings at the start of 2022.      Some Russian officials have suggested that if Russian assets are confiscated then foreign investors' assets stuck in special so-called type ""C"" accounts in Russia could face the same fate. Some foreign assets were effectively locked in the C accounts.      It is not clear exactly how much money is in these accounts but Russian officials have said it is comparable to the $300 billion of frozen Russian reserves.      Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last week that there were significant funds in the C accounts. Russia's central bank declined to comment.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/kremlin-list-western-assets-seized-if-russian-assets-confiscated/,Negative,['stocks' 'loans' 'insurance']
2023-12-29 18:50:03,Jeepney drivers offer free rides in Negros Occidental despite phaseout fears,"  BACOLOD CITY, Philippines - Some drivers of traditional public utility vehicles (PUVs) plying here for decades offered free rides amid fears of losing their livelihood due to the government's December 31 deadline to comply with a pricey modernization plan.       Students like Nichollen Fhaye de Vera, a psychology major in Bacolod, were among those who got to avail of these rides. She said the jeepney driver even told her it was a form of Christmas gift for commuters like her.      ""On December 27, at around 10 in the morning, I rode a jeepney parked near a bank. I was the first passenger to board, and as soon as I sat in the front seat, the driver said, ‘It's nice that you got on because this is free . ‘ He subsequently invited other passengers to come aboard as well,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.      De Vera was unable to ask for the driver's name, but she felt the weight of sadness and fear as these drivers could lose their source of income.      The deadline for individual traditional jeepney operators to join a cooperative or corporation is December 31, 2023; failure to do so would result in losing their operating license.      At least a hundred people benefited from the free trips on Wednesday, December 27, which was organized by five small-time jeepney drivers.                       Must Read                          PUV consolidation deadline stays as gov't vows to prevent transport crisis                                                                                         Last December 22, the United Negros Drivers and Operators Center (UNDOC)-Piston and Bacolod Alliance of Commuters, Operators, and Drivers (BACOD)-Manibela staged a protest march to denounce what they deemed as a phaseout of PUVs in the country.      ""We, drivers and small-time operators, emphasize that our opposition to the franchise consolidation and modernization program does not signify our resistance to progress. To genuinely enhance public transport, the government should subsidize our acquisition of modern units and involve us throughout the decision-making processes,"" a joint statement read.      One of the major concerns of the small-time jeepney owners and drivers is the high cost of modernized jeepneys,  estimated  to be 1,766.7% more expensive than the traditional ones.       The traditional jeepney costs between P150,000 and P250,000, while the modern one can reach as high as P2.8 million, which puts further strain on the finances of small-time drivers and operators.       The government, however, pledged to subsidize a mere 5.7% of the project's overall cost, or only P160,000.      The Center for Energy, Ecology, and Development (CEED) said air pollution reduction efforts are negligible if modernization efforts are focused on jeepneys instead of private vehicles.      According to data from the Department of Energy and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, they recorded over 9 million registered vehicles in the country. Of the number, 250,000 or just 2% are jeepneys.      ""Not to mention, private car owners would also be more likely financially capable of modernizing their vehicles,"" the CEED said.      Students' voice       The Technopacer-Talisay , the official student organ of the Carlos Hilado Memorial State University, expressed support for jeepney drivers in their call to junk the PUV Modernization Program, which they described as anti-driver and anti-people.      The group said the December 31 phaseout plan of the government for the traditional jeepneys across the country poses a challenge to at least 25.8 million commuters nationwide, directly affecting students and low-income earners who rely on the affordability and accessibility of jeepneys for their daily transport.      While they agree that there is a need to modernize the country's transport system, they emphasized that the government should not spark social injustice and economic struggle for the marginalized.      ""We urge the authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue with jeepney drivers, operators, and the commuting public to find a sustainable solution that balances modernization with social responsibility. We stand in solidarity with the drivers, operators, and commuters, whose lives will be impacted, advocating for policies that protect their rights and welfare,"" the statement read. -  Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/jeepney-drivers-offer-free-rides-negros-occidental-phaseout-fears/,Positive,['loans' 'insurance' 'credit cards']
2023-12-29 12:21:51,Eyes on the prize: Tracking Marcos' priority bills in 2023,"  MANILA, Philippines - During his second  State of the Nation Address (SONA)  in July, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. outlined key legislative priorities for his administration, giving emphasis on enhancing the Philippine economy and implementing financial and governmental reforms.      The Marcos administration has  17 priority pieces of legislation , most of which have secured approval in the lower house and are presently under review in their respective Senate committees. These include:         Creation of the Department of Water Resources Management (Pending at Senate committee level)      Military and Uniformed Personnel Pension (Approved in House of Representatives; pending in the Senate, second reading)       Amendment of the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act (Pending in Senate)      Ease of Paying Taxes bill (For enrollment)      LGU Income Classification Act (Enacted)      The Philippine Immigration Act (Approved in the House of Representatives)      Tatak Pinoy (Proudly Filipino) law (For enrollment)      Anti-financial accounts scamming (Pending at Senate committee level)      The Blue Economy law (Pending in Senate, second reading)      New Government Auditing Code       Motor vehicle user's charge/road user's tax (Pending at Senate committee level)      New Government Procurement Law (Pending at Senate committee level)      Excise tax on single-use plastics (Pending at Senate committee level)      Amendment of the Cooperative Code (Approved in the House of Representatives)      Amendment of the Fisheries Code      VAT on digital services (Pending at Senate committee level)      Rationalization of mining fiscal regime (Approved in House of Representatives)        However, only one out of 17 bills has so far come to fruition in Marcos' second year. Overall, Marcos laid down 74 priority bills since he assumed office last year, but only 10 have so far been signed into law.      Take a look at some of these bills and how the Marcos administration has followed through on its legislative agenda during its one-and-a-half year in office.       LGU Income Classification Act       Signed in October ,  the  Republic Act (RA) 11964  institutionalizes the automatic income classification of local government units (LGUs).       Under this legislation, the Department of Finance (DOF) is tasked with the automatic classification of provinces, cities, and municipalities into five income classes.       The income brackets for provinces are as follows:        First Class: P1.5 billion or more      Second Class: P900 million but less than P1.5 billion      Third Class: P700 million but less than P900 million      Fourth Class: P500 million but less than P700 million      Fifth Class: Less than P500 million        The income brackets for cities are as follows:        First Class: P1.3 billion or more      Second Class: P1 billion but less than P1.3 billion      Third Class: P800 million but less than P1 billion      Fourth Class: P500 million but less than P800 million      Fifth Class: Less than P500 million        The income brackets for municipalities are as follows:        First Class: P200 million or more      Second Class: P160 million or more, but less than P200 million      Third Class: P130 million or more, but less than P160 million      Fourth Class: P90 million or more, but less than P130 million      Fifth Class: Less than P90 million        The legislation also mandates a regular reassessment and adjustment of the income classification of LGUs every three years to accurately mirror shifts in the economy and local development.        Ease of Paying Taxes bill, Tatak Pinoy bill       Two bills from the SONA 2023 list are also currently awaiting the President's approval. These are the  Ease of Paying Taxes bill  and the  Tatak Pinoy (Proudly Filipino) bill .      The proposed Ease of Paying Taxes bill aims to streamline the tax system and boost citizen's compliance through key measures: the bill simplifies tax filing for micro and small businesses, introducing an only 2-page income tax return, reduced penalties, and eliminating specific withholding taxes.      If passed, it will also mandate the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to develop a digital platform for tax filing and payment, enhancing efficiency in tax administration and establishing taxpayer assistance centers and hotlines to facilitate compliance.      The bill also aims to exempt Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) earning below a set income threshold from filing income tax returns.      In September, both the Senate and the House of Representatives ratified the report of the bicameral conference committee, which resolved discrepancies in their individual versions of the proposed Ease of Paying Taxes bill.      Later this year, both Houses also passed their respective versions of the Tatak Pinoy bill (Senate bill 2218 and House bill 8601), with the goal of boosting the international competitiveness of Philippine products and services, particularly those produced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).       Tatak Pinoy bill aims to support the diversification and advancement of domestic production, generate jobs especially in rural regions, and lower dependence on imported goods while fostering economic self-sufficiency.       New Agrarian Emancipation Act       Before his second SONA, Marcos signed  Republic Act 11953 or the New Agrarian Emancipation Act  which aims to offer assistance to agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) grappling with debt from previous agrarian reform initiatives.  (READ: Will the New Agrarian Emancipation Act liberate Filipino farmers and boost PH agriculture? )      The act pardons all outstanding amortizations, interests, and surcharges accumulated by ARBs on lands granted to them under Presidential Decree (PD) 27, Republic Act 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, and RA 9700 or the Extension of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.       This measure clears the financial slate for  600,000 ARBs .        Maharlika Investment law       Despite facing significant backlash, the Marcos administration proceeded to enact the controversial Republic Act 11954, also known as the Maharlika Investment Law, which established the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), the country's first sovereign wealth fund ( READ: FAST FACTS: What is the Maharlika Investment Fund? )      According to the law, the primary objective of the MIF is to establish a safeguard against economic downturns and ensure financial stability for future generations. Supporters of the MIF argued that it would enhance financial security by setting aside a portion of the government's revenue and making prudent investments.       Yet, prior to its approval, strong concerns persisted regarding the fund's transparency and accountability process.       Critics said that the law seemed to prioritize private investment over social development objectives. Some also voiced concerns about potential misuse of the fund and the absence of safeguards for Filipino taxpayers. (READ:  Experts worry about Maharlika fund's impact on independence of Bangko Sentral )       Internet Transaction Act        This year, the Marcos administration introduced  Republic Act 11967, also known as the Internet Transactions Act of 2023 (ITA) , to regulate and foster the growth of e-commerce in the country.      Key features of the  law  include cracking down on unfair trade practices, enforcing product safety standards, improving dispute resolution, and ensuring transparency from sellers regarding product information, prices, and terms of sale.       Trabaho Para sa Bayan Act        Republic Act 11962, known as the  Trabaho Para sa Bayan Act , is the National Employment Master Plan for the Philippines. Signed into law in September, the law aims to create a more comprehensive and effective approach to employment generation and job creation in the country.      The Trabaho Para sa Bayan Inter-Agency Council, headed by the National Economic and Development Authority, is tasked with formulating a comprehensive plan for job creation and economic recovery. This plan will outline development timelines spanning three, six, and ten years.         While a number of laws, mostly economic in nature, have been passed since Marcos came to power, most of his legislative agenda remains pending in Congress. In fact, nine of the 17 priority bills he stated during the second SONA, were carried over from the first SONA.      For instance, the bill reforming the generous but costly pension system for military and uniformed personnel has only recently passed the lower house's scrutiny. (READ:  EXPLAINER: How generous military pension is pushing Philippines to fiscal collapse)       Meanwhile, the  proposed 12% value-added tax (VAT) in digital services  like  Netflix and Disney+  also remains pending in the Senate.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/eyes-on-the-prize-tracking-marcos-priority-bills-2023/,Neutral,['retirement' 'stocks' 'insurance']
2023-12-29 11:17:00,[In This Economy] Looking back at the Philippine economy in 2023,"  In retrospect, 2023 was pretty eventful for the Philippine economy. Here are some of the highlights.      Taming inflation      On the bright side, inflation has abated. After reaching a 14-year high of 8.7% in January, inflation has gone down to 4.1% in November. That's just a hairline above the government's upper 4% target. Still, the average from January to November was still quite high at 6.2%. And lower inflation doesn't mean lower prices.                   Figure 1.       Inflation went down largely because of declines in food prices. But in August and September, there was an uptick of food prices, particularly rice. This prompted the Marcos administration to impose  price ceilings  on rice.       But as predicted by Econ 101, this ill-advised policy quickly led to a shortage of good quality rice and large losses for thousands of rice retailers. When a finance undersecretary posted a supply and demand graph about this, she was  unceremoniously sacked . Who knew supply and demand could become a symbol of resistance against bad policies?       In response to inflation, Marcos also promised to go after cartels in rice and other commodities like sugar. But inflation went down by itself without any cartel being punished (we don't even know how many there are, exactly).      BSP's rate hikes      Another factor that helped lower inflation is the successive interest rate hikes imposed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). From 2022, the BSP raised its ""policy rate"" by a total of 4.50 percentage points, the largest jump in recent history. Much of this happened in 2022, but the hikes continued in 2023.       The BSP's objective has been to discourage borrowing, temper demand throughout the economy, and abate inflation. This seems to have paid off, albeit with a lag and albeit a resulting  economic slowdown  in key sectors, including our largest growth source: consumption by private households.                    Figure 2.       Whether the BSP rate hikes (which continued until October) were the best response or not to inflation attracted some debate. Some say this is an overreaction, because inflation was largely due to supply and not demand, and that the rate hikes unnecessarily took a toll on growth.       Others say the hikes were well-timed to manage people's expectations of inflation (because runaway expectations can lead to higher actual inflation, as in a self-fulfilling prophecy). In any case, this year showed us  how tricky it is to fight inflation  in the short-run.      Too many trips, too few investments      Investments slowed down significantly in 2023. From January to September, foreign direct investments (FDIs)  dropped by 16%  from 2022 to 2023. This, despite President Marcos' multiple foreign trips (which "" nearly doubled "" from 2022) and his  constant exhortations  to the global business community to invest in the Philippines (starting with the massive junket that was the January  Davos trip ).      The shortage of investments is masked by the Marcos administration with propaganda. Said the Department of Trade and Industry recently, Marcos' trips attracted nearly  P4 trillion  in investments so far. But a close look at the data will show that 91% of that are just pledges - investment agreements both signed and yet unsigned, and those still on the drawing board.        I wrote  in October that the factors that could be turning off investors include slower growth, the uneven response to inflation, and policy uncertainty. Lack of infrastructure and high energy costs are also major turnoffs. These need to be fixed first before we can expect a boom in investments.      Speaking of investments, in mid-December, Marcos also  created a new cabinet post : the Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs (SAPIEA). This new ""super economic manager,"" as some people are calling it, is tasked to oversee the current crop of economic managers. Marcos also appointed to this post Frederick Go, previously the president and CEO of Robinsons Land. This shakeup will lead to massive changes in the way economic management is done. One more thing to watch out for in 2024.      Maharlika fund      After much hype, Marcos signed in July (in time for his second State of the Nation Address) the law creating his pet project, the  Maharlika Investment Fund . This, despite warnings (including a  discussion paper  written by myself and 20 other colleagues at the University of the Philippines School of Economics) that such a pseudo-sovereign wealth fund is ""still beyond repair"" and a major threat to the public coffers.       Indeed, some of the ill effects are already coming to fruition. State-owned banks now lacking capital have sought  regulatory relief  from the BSP. Foreign analysts are also  beginning to raise red flags .      In November, Marcos  suspended  Marharlika's implementing rules and regulations, and had a team tweak it and  loosen qualifications  for key officials. Shortly after, Joel Consing, an experienced businessman who worked closely with billionaire tycoons before, was appointed as Maharlika's first president and CEO. A few days before Christmas, Marcos also  filled the rest of Maharlika's board .       Will investors put money into Maharlika? And what investments will Maharlika get into? In his first presser, Consing  laid out plans  even without board approval yet. Let's wait and see in 2024.      SIM registration, jeepney modernization      Some policies with economic implications were highlighted in the news. One of them is the implementation of the SIM registration law. By April 2023, people had to register their SIMs on pain of deactivation. One problem is the government's lack of commitment: it  extended the deadline  because too few were registering.      More importantly, just like many well-meaning laws, the SIM registration law was beset with  unintended consequences . Text scams continued to proliferate after the law was implemented, fueled by a roaring black market trade in illegal SIMs, as well as  powerful networks  that were able to register even unopened SIM cards. This goes to prove, once again, that bans typically don't work in eliminating bad things (we should have learned from the inutile Duterte drug war).      Jeepney modernization was another policy that was put off this year, but this time owing to strong backlash from organizations of jeepney drivers and operators. Although most stakeholders agree with modernization in principle, the challenge is how to make the transition as just and painless as possible for drivers and operators who need to shell out significant sums to replace their old vehicles.       In March, I talked about this issue with reporter Lance Spencer Yu in Rappler's  Newsbreak Chats .  Financing is at the crux of the debacle , and until this is resolved, expect continued friction in 2024.       Education crisis      Finally, in December, the  latest results  of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) came out. Unsurprisingly, the Philippines ranked among the worst countries in terms of math, science, and reading scores. While we didn't deteriorate, we essentially stagnated from 2018.       In a way, then, this news of the Philippines' education crisis is no news at all. But it's a shame and a threat to our future nonetheless. I wrote weeks ago, ""Our nation's future will continue to be bleak unless we do something substantive to stop the learning crisis in its tracks.""       Thankfully, the situation is not helpless. In a  Rappler Talk  interview I did in October, I talked to Noam Angrist, an economist, who conducted a large multi-country study with international colleagues, that showed even small and cheap interventions (such as calls and text messages) can work wonders to reverse the learning losses wrought by the pandemic. And some of the biggest improvements they saw were in the Philippines. All hope is not lost.      On that note, let us look forward to a Philippine economy in 2024 that's better and kinder to us all. -  Rappler.com        JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of   False Nostalgia: The Marcos ""Golden Age"" Myths and How to Debunk Them  .

2023-12-28 19:58:07,[ANALYSIS] Seeking the truth behind the electricity subsidy lie,"  Last July, in a forum on the high cost of electricity, a Department of Energy (DOE) official was asked why prices had reached unprecedented levels. Breaching P11 per kilowatt-hour (kwH), prices that should average between P8/kwh to P9/kwH consistently hovered over P10/kwH for almost a year. It was at those levels since a least-cost power generator was literally forced out of the grid, effectively facilitating a way for a higher cost plant with lower dependability ratings to enter the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM).      At the WESM where generators offer their capacities subject to a dispatch protocol, a second cap was imposed as prices bloated higher than those under bilateral contracts. As a high-price metric, simply count the number of caps and the frequency these are invoked. We have two high-price caps and records show almost a third (28.28%) of the time, the second was needed to forestall astronomical price hikes.      For consumers, power rates remain on a rollercoaster ride, volatile, and prohibitively high relative to our capacity to pay. Understandably, believing we have one of the highest rates in the region, such affects not only household economics but also our attractiveness as a viable destination for critical foreign direct investments (FDI).      Like a bad joke on the existence and impact of power price subsidies, quoting verbatim, a DOE factotum said, ""It's true, our price of electricity is higher than other countries in Asia. First of all, we are not subsidized. If we subsidize, who will subsidize? It will come from us.""      Let us examine that statement. It is not a question of subsidized ""apples"" against un-subsidized ""oranges."" We need to analyze beyond simplistic soundbites.      Invoking the narrowest interpretation of a direct government grant to lower prices, the statement provided an excuse. Unfortunately, the statement is misleading. Heaven forbid, it is a lie. It is not a question of ""if"" we subsidize. We subsidize. Our billing statements are proof.      Since every centavo in a billing statement is authorized by energy regulators, the current 20% to 100% subsidies selectively granted to poorer consumers in a franchise area represent socialized pricing effectively government-created and imposed.      Categorized under ""Subsidies,"" lifeline rates were created under RA 9136 and later amended by RA 11552. To recover the discounts, distribution utilities (DU) bill all end-users in their franchise area thus re-channeling from the rich to the poor.      Conceptually questionable, these are applied a Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 12% - a tax on a ""tax"" as ludicrous as a VAT on systems losses.                       Must Read                          [ANALYSIS] How bias and regulatory capture bloat power rates                                                                                         Supply somewhat stabilized when an emergency bilateral agreement between our largest DU and a significant least cost generator was signed. This allowed the latter to average-down power rates.      All would have been hunky-dory had not the agreement been terminated and shortages again loomed. Worsening matters, a Power Supply Agreement (PSA) negotiated through a Competitive Bidding Process for 1,800 megawatts (MW) remained un-approved by government regulators.      Fortunately, private DU rates in Luzon are 33% below the average for 46 other markets including those in the Visayas and Mindanao. Between June and July, rates fell mostly due to the bilateral least cost PSAs and a seasonal reduction in generation charges.      During the cooler rainy season, demand decreases. Hydroelectric plants likewise kick in. This is validated by the 9.21% incidences of breaches of WESM's secondary price cap.      A study conducted by the International Energy Consultants (IEC) is being cited to justify that our rates are reasonably priced relative to other electricity subsidized economies - a notion that supports the DOE's declarations on subsidies.      Unfortunately, persistently high rates impact negatively on potential FDI where neighboring economies charge less for power as they consciously trade off subsidizing their markets to attract FDI and incentivize local industry to create jobs, lower inflation, and produce higher per capita GDP and greater manufacturing activity. Vietnam's subsidy policy is a case in point.      Despite official misrepresentations, subsidies do exist in our milieu albeit are charged against non-subsidized consumers within the franchise. Apparently, these do not rationalize rates enough to attract FDI. During the first nine months of 2023, as rates bloated, FDI fell by 16% from the same period in 2022.      Subsidized communities within a DU's franchise exist, but what about unconnected off-grid communities?      In rural areas subsidies are existentially critical in providing electricity, even at prohibitive costs where the DOE has failed to connect communities to the national transmission network. These enable electricity cooperatives (EC) to secure debt-capital to establish renewable energy (RE) plants to average down rates, and co-generate or replace higher cost power provided by the state.      A 2021 study from the European Union-Access to Sustainable Energy Program (EU-ASEP) recognizes the existence of subsidies and interestingly, they show a fatal flaw in the DOE's subsidy program.      For off-grid communities there is a Universal Charge for Missionary Electrification (UCME) for generators and end-consumers to catalyze electrification, and through its subsidized approved generation rate (SAGR), equitable power pricing.      As currently applied, following a flawed uniform subsidy system, the DOE formula grants subsidies as a function of consumption regardless of consumer class. How ridiculous is that? Should an off-grid community host a higher power-consuming enterprise like a quarry, a mill, or a canning facility where these enjoy higher subsidies and given relative cost impacts, the system burdens lesser consuming households who enjoy less subsidies.      Worsening matters, UCME has been increasing exponentially as officials rethink granting subsidies in its entirety. Since UCME provides bankable security for ECs to operate their own debt-capitalized plants, proposals to excise or reduce the UCME would be a death knell for rural ECs.      First, energy officials effectively cursed island grids with expensive diesel-driven decrepit power plants. Now officials deny the existence of subsidies yet lifeline rates, UCME, and SAGR exist. Finally, there is a deal-driven drive to install nuclear plants in communities inadequately electrified yet suffering from the highest power rates. All result from a toxic chemistry of poor policies, misguided prioritization, and misinformation.  - Rappler.com        Dean de la Paz is a former investment banker and managing director of a New Jersey-based power company operating in the Philippines.

2023-12-28 14:05:40,Cebu City Council increases 2024 annual budget to P25 billion,"  CEBU, Philippines - Less than a week after deliberating on the previously approved P22.093-billion annual budget for 2024, the Cebu City Council increased the amount by almost P4 billion.      In an online special session on Wednesday, December 27, 2023, the council amended the budget ordinance after the budget and finance committee acknowledged ""typographical errors"" in the previously approved ordinance. (READ:  Cebu legislators slash Mike Rama's proposed P100-billion budget for 2024 by 78% )      The errors discussed by the council were on the City Legal Office's (CLO) maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) and on the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (LDRRMF) -- where the budget increase could be attributed to.      Following a unanimous decision to amend the budget ordinance, the city council approved the revised amount of P25,833,177,745.20 as the annual budget for next year -- marking an increase of around 17% from the previously approved budget for 2024 on December 22.       The revised amount also represents half of the City Government's P50 billion annual budget for 2023.      The reconsideration of the annual budget ordinance required a two-thirds vote of the council, with at least 12 councilors voting in favor of the amendment.      'Typographical  error'      Cebu City Councilor Jocelyn Pesquera admitted that the first error was made on the CLO's MOOE where a typographical error has inflated the amount by over a billion.       ""We already approved the budget ordinance last week; however, Mr. Chairman, I would admit that I made an error in adding...I was able to...instead the amount for the City Legal (Office), their office supply, supposedly it's only P1.9 million plus I put P1 billion (plus), which affected the entire budget because it's like a P1 billion difference,"" Pesquera told the council.      The accurate budget for the CLO's MOOE is at P1,980,000, but the reflected amount in the original ordinance was at P1,980,000,000.      'Disaster fund adjustment'      Another adjustment made by the council was on the appropriation for the LDRRMF.      Pesquera said the budget ordinance approved last week only indicated 5% of the approved budget, which is only over P20 billion, for the city's LDRRMF; however, with projected revenue of P100 billion for next year, the city's LDRRMF should be 5% of the P100 billion.      The error was spotted during the review of the ordinance by the budget office staff, Pesquera said.      Minority councilors Nestor Archival and Mary Ann Delos Santos sought clarification on the errors regarding the LDRRMF and what would happen if the revenue targets were not met.       Pesquera assured them that control mechanisms are in place.      ""That's why in our proposed ordinance, we put in control mechanisms that in case the collection will not be, let's say for 2024, the collection or targets will not be realized, the amount that will be considered as continuing will only be based on the actual collection. The same tenure that we did for this year,"" Pesquera said.      Wenceslao added that the adjustment on the LDRRMF is still within the bounds of the law, citing his committee report that the appropriation for the total annual budget would not exceed P50 billion.      Meanwhile, Cebu City Mayor Michael Rama and the executive department have yet to specify what measures they will take on the slashed budget.       Rama, who, as mayor, can veto the council-approved budget ordinance, previously asked the council to approve a P100 billion annual budget for next year.  - Rappler.com                                                Tax collection is biggest priority for 2024 - Cebu City councilors                                                                                     ",https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-city-council-increases-2024-annual-budget/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']

2023-12-24 17:12:19,[Two Pronged] Our struggling business is causing a strain in our relationship,"   Rappler's Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes.        Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives .       Together, they have written two books:  Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality  and  Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.            Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer,        I'm hoping your advice will help. I used to go to a counselor, who unfortunately passed away this year.         Since my 20s, I've tried various businesses. Just when I think things would take off, they develop problems, forcing me to move on and look for another venture to invest in. I dream of making it like the hardworking people in ""Shark Tank.""        But I'm already in my 30s and I know I should be more stable. My current business was mainly training dogs, but the pandemic and limited resources put a stop to that. I think God/fate led me to take care of various dog breeds as a way to earn an alternative income, apart from another business I set up, which is doing moderately okay.         I try to manifest things like a better home for my dogs, and a better set-up for the business. But during the past years, my partner and I encountered problems such as untrustworthy buyers, flaky staff members (whose negligence and abandonment caused the death of some prized puppies), and even an irate neighbor who campaigned to have my dogs confiscated by the city veterinarian. These events have put a strain on my relationship with my longtime partner ""Peter.""         Sometimes he expresses his anger or disappointment that because of our business he is unable to accept other better-paying or fulfilling projects.  Sometimes, this disappointment is manifested when Peter makes snide comments about me or the business. I get even by dishing the same back at him, even when I feel on some level that this isn't healthy. We've been together for about eight years. He says he plans to marry me, but I'm not sure anymore, especially because our resources (especially finances) are still not solid.         Some friends have advised that we seek couples' counseling, but I'm not sure if Peter will cooperate. Another friend recommended a financial counselor, but I felt intimidated when they asked for my annual report, statement of assets and liabilities, and financial report. I feel that I can still make it with the right investors who understand me, or maybe go to a business school with an entrepreneurship program, but these setbacks have been getting me down.  What steps can I take in my relationship with Peter, and our businesses?         Thank you po.         Zillah            Dear Zillah,      There are two issues at play here: business and relationships.      Starting with business, it is widely recognized that to create a successful company requires an array of skills that not everyone possesses. It demands a product, an organization, a marketing strategy, legal and accounting inputs, banking facilities, an appropriate workforce etc. It also requires management skill to nurture the fledgling, grow it into a viable entity and then expand it to meet the (hopefully) burgeoning market.      Since all these skills seldom reside in one person, a key component to success is the ability to hire and retain the right people for the right jobs. You intimate that your experience to date as an entrepreneur has not been one of unmitigated success. This may be because while you have had good ideas, you have not had the necessary skills to turn ideas into productive ventures.       If the very notion of annual reports, statement of assets and liabilities, and cash flow statements intimidates you, but you still wish to be an entrepreneur, then perhaps enrolling in a business school is indeed the way to go.      Regarding your relationship with Peter, mixing business and pleasure is not always a good idea. It is not clear what role Peter plays in your ventures but it is clear that he is unhappy with it. Perhaps he would actually be better off pursuing his own business projects while you employ a professional manager to fill his role. That way you would have a happier partner in your romantic life and a more committed professional in your business.       Best wishes,      JAFBaer       Dear Zillah,      Thank you very much for your letter. Mr. Baer is correct in saying two issues at play here are business and relationships. I love how dispassionate he is when analyzing what you've shared. This makes it clear that  walang personalan  (no criticism of you or your decisions), just a clearer assessment of what might be better decisions on your part. The issue of relationships affects yours with Peter, but your relationship with yourself even more so.      First, super duper congratulations for recognizing and then ""admitting"" your faults in this letter to us. That is a gift not many people have. However, as Leonardo da Vinci once said: "" I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do. ""      So, when you say ""I get even by dishing the same back at him (Peter's snide remarks), even when I feel on some level that this isn't healthy,"" perhaps reminding yourself of da Vinci words about knowing not being enough might be a good idea?       Another example of knowing not being enough is when you say: ""I'm already in my 30s and I know I should be more stable."" Actually, this brings to mind something some people do which they seem to think absolves them from things; such as ""I'm sorry for being am ahole, but I grew up with no one to guide me.""      A more mature way of looking at things would be to say, perhaps even with a sigh, ""I grew up with no one guiding me, which sometimes explains why I behave like an ahole, but that is no excuse to continue behaving like one. I know I have this vulnerability of not being guided since young, so all the more I should work towards being less a**hole-like"".      I hope my words on the non financial aspects has also helped, Zillah, and if not, I am heartened by the knowledge that Mr Baer's words have.       All the best and happy holidays,      MG Holmes.       - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/two-pronged-struggling-business-strained-relationship/,Negative,['retirement' '' '']
2023-12-24 11:48:51,FACT CHECK: Link for ‘PNP Non-Uniformed Personnel' application is fake,"   Claim:  The Philippine National Police (PNP) is hiring non-uniformed personnel. Applications may be submitted through a link shared in a Facebook post.       Rating: FALSE        Why we fact-checked this:  The claim was made in a December 21 post on a Facebook group with 249,300 members. The post was made by the page ""PRC News Update,"" which has 3,000 followers. As of writing, the post has 449 reactions and 414 shares.      According to the post, interested applicants must be at least an elementary graduate, 21 years old, and 5'0 tall. The post includes a link to a supposed application link.               The bottom line:  The supposed application link is fake, and is not officially recognized by the PNP or any of its departments.      Upon clicking the link, users are redirected to a blog page, not a government website affiliated with the PNP.       Official news and updates, including information on vacant positions, can be found on the official website of the  Non-Uniformed Personnel Affairs Division  of the PNP's  Directorate for Personnel and Records Management  (DPRM). The DPRM is tasked with the management of PNP uniformed and non-uniformed personnel.       Not affiliated:  The Facebook page that posted the false claim has been flagged by another government agency for sharing fake application links.      In its  post , the Philippine Coast Guard also warned the public to be vigilant against false information on government vacancies and online applications.       Wrong details:  The Facebook post also listed erroneous eligibility requirements.       According to a  March 2023 notice of vacancy  for non-uniformed personnel posted by the DPRM, educational qualifications and experience required vary depending on the position. The age and height requirements in the misleading Facebook post are not mentioned.      Instead of linking to an application, the notice instructed interested applicants to submit required documents in person, by email, or through a courier.

2023-12-23 14:41:40,Tax collection is biggest priority for 2024 - Cebu City councilors,"  CEBU CITY, Philippines - Cebu City has its hands full trying to raise tax collections after the city council reached a consensus to slash the budget for fiscal year 2024.       City councilors recently  cut Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama's proposed P100-billion budget by 78%  - down to only P22.093 billion for 2024.       The budget cuts were essential to bring Cebu City Hall's 2023 actual revenue in line with the projected revenue for 2024, Cebu City Councilor Jocelyn Pesquera said in an interview with  SunStar Cebu  on Friday, December 22.       In December 2022, the  council approved Rama's proposed P50-billion annual budget for 2023 . However, most projects and programs were left unfunded and postponed after the city managed to collect only a gross amount of about P7.5 billion as of October 2023.       Cebu City had an annual budget of about P10 billion in 2022.       Pesquera, the majority floor leader and vice chair of the budget and finance committee, emphasized that if the funding source for the proposed P100-billion 2024 annual budget relies on projections, it would be prudent for the city to prioritize boosting revenue collection first before considering a budget increase.       Tax revenue       According to the local finance committee (LFC), the bulk of the source of funding will be taken from an estimated tax revenue of about P77.5 billion, as the LFC already factored in the possible approval of the ordinance  updating  the city's real property tax (RPT) code.       As of the last regular session on Wednesday, December 20, however, the council has yet to finalize its deliberations on the matter.       City treasurer Mare Vae Reyes acknowledged in an earlier interview that Rama's veto of the initially-approved ordinance for updating the tax code indicated acceptance that tax revenue collection targets will not be achieved.       On the updated RPT code deliberation, Pesquera said the council is taking into consideration the property owners' ability to pay and what's best for the city government. The situation indicates that the executive department will be unable to support the proposed P100-billion budget with expected revenues.      Pesquera added that if the suggested increase in the fair market value of properties is implemented, it could discourage investors from doing business in the city.       For instance, the proposed RPT adjustment in the north district is expected to increase by 3,200%. This is where the IT Park and Cebu Business Park are located.      'A peso for this'       In the approved amendments, at least 32 city departments and offices were given only one peso for proposed expenses in 2024.       Majority of the proposed procurements were for heavy utility equipment, IT and communication equipment, and insurance. Among the most sought after procurements were motor vehicles.       The city's non-office peace and order program alone proposed a budget of P20.6 million for motor vehicles, while three sub-offices under the Department of Public Services asked for a total of P15.32 million for the same items.       ""For us, it's no longer a priority. However, if we have realized additional income and savings, they can propose a supplemental budget,"" Cebu City Councilor Noel Wenceslao told Rappler on Saturday, December 23. The city managed to save P128.5 million from possible expenses on motor vehicles.       On Friday, Cebu City Councilor Joel Garganera said that there was an initial proposal to procure electric vehicles but this was turned down as it was not in line with the Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP). Garganera added that the city will be exerting more effort to include tree-planting activities and other long-term environmental sustainability programs for the LCCAP.       Rappler tried to reach Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama and Cebu City Budget Officer lawyer Jerone Castillo to comment on the 2024 annual budget proposal.       According to Wenceslao, the mayor has the power to veto the proposal. Rama has yet to issue a statement. -  Rappler.com        Wenilyn Sabalo is an Aries Rufo Journalism fellow for 2023-2024.

2023-12-22 17:07:12,How Marcos justified his veto of 2 provisions in the 2024 budget,"  MANILA, Philippines - President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed the 2024 national budget, but vetoed two sections.       His explanation was contained in a December 20 letter to House Speaker Martin Romualdez, although Malacanang has yet to release a copy of that letter.      Portions of that letter, however, were quoted by the Presidential Communications Office in a press release sent to the media on Friday, December 22.      Here are the vetoed provisions, and President Marcos' justification.      1. DOJ's revolving fund      As of writing, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has yet to upload a full copy of the 2024 General Appropriations Act (GAA), the formal title for the budget, but apparently, Congress approved a special provision in the budget of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of the Secretary on the creation of a revolving fund.      A revolving fund, simply put, is a fund that can be used to finance an agency's ongoing operations because it is always replenished with repayments.       A 2011 document from  the DBM  said income derived by the national government from rentals for the use of facilities, or from fees for board and lodging, may make up a revolving fund that can be utilized for the maintenance and other operating expenses of these facilities.      It added that revolving funds can only be created in cases where they are explicitly authorized by law.      But Marcos said no law authorizes the DOJ to establish a revolving fund, and the purpose indicated is not for business-type activities anyway.        ""It may be emphasized that the service fees sought to be charged and collected are to be imposed upon complaints and affidavits filed with the National Prosecution Service, and petitions for review filed before the DOJ, when, in fact, such pleadings are filed with the said agencies by virtue of their jurisdiction vested by law,"" Marcos added.      The 2023 budget of the DOJ  did not have  a special provision on a revolving fund.       2. Implementation of the Career Executive Service Development Program       Marcos also rejected Section 38 under the general provision of the GAA, pertaining to the national government's implementation of the Career Executive Service Development Program.      The Career Executive Service (CES) was  created  in 1972 under the Marcos Sr. administration ""to form a continuing pool of well-selected and development-oriented career administrators who shall provide competent and faithful service.""      Under the  concept of CES , career executive service officers are given ranks and CES positions.      Marcos pointed out that the Career Executive Service Board (CESB), created by virtue of his father's Presidential Decree 336, already governs the CES.      He added that the CESB's mandate was already further delineated because the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) was  tasked to come on board  and ""prepare a CES program appropriate and necessary for the organization and operation of the CES.""      As of 2023, both CESB and DAP have their own, separate budgets in the GAA. For the President, this may have removed the need for a separate section under the general provisions of the 2024 GAA.       ""In vetoing such section, he said that the section does not relate to any particular appropriation in this budget,"" the PCO said.       What happens next      Article 6, Section 27 of the Constitution states that the President has the power to veto any bill passed by Congress, or veto any particular item in an appropriation bill.       The legislative branch also has the power to override that veto by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of both chambers of Congress.      Lawmakers have not quashed a veto made by the President on a bill in recent history.

2023-12-22 16:00:00,[In This Economy] A new 'super economic manager'? Why this should worry you,"  In a surprising move just before Christmas, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. seems to have outsourced his job of managing the economy.      On December 15, he signed an  executive order  creating a new Cabinet position that will serve as some sort of ""super economic manager.""      The official title is Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs (SAPIEA), who will be appointed by, and reporting directly to, the President.      When the executive order was published December 18, Malacanang also announced that the first SAPEIA will be none other than  Frederick Go , 54, longtime president and CEO of Robinsons Land Corporation, and nephew of the late business tycoon John Gokongwei.      This is a promotion for Go, who in January 2023 had already been appointed  presidential adviser for investment and economic affairs  (PAIEA). Now, that position has been leveled up to a Cabinet post, so Go really needs to divest his business interests.      At the time of his appointment as SAPIEA, Go was still serving as director, president, and CEO of Robinsons Land. But on December 20, he let go of these positions.      As early as now, one can tell that the new super economic manager post might be a game-changer. Apart from creating redundancies in the managing of the economy, it will also upend the dynamics between the President and his economic managers.      But more unsettlingly, this new SAPIEA also gives the private sector much greater say in how the economy is managed. There might be lingering conflict of interest, too, along the way.      Redundant      Let's examine the roles of this new super economic manager. As you'll see, he's all-powerful but massively redundant.      First, the office of the SAPIEA ""shall ensure effective integration, coordination, and implementation of the various investment and economic policies and programs of the Government.""      Wait. This is already the job description of the economic managers. So we must ask: what is the value-added of adding yet another economic manager standing between the President and the current economic team?      Second, the SAPIEA shall provide ""timely, relevant, and strategic advice on matters and issues involving economic concerns based on recent economic data or information, market trends and global developments.""      Redundant, too. This is something that the NEDA secretary could and should already be doing. After all, the government's statistics agency is under NEDA, and the NEDA secretary is often deemed the top economist in government. Why does there have to be an intermediary or conduit for economic advice, in the person of the SAPIEA?      Third, the SAPIEA shall, ""in coordination with the EDG [Economic Development Group], and subject to the approval of the President, identify the priority programs, activities and projects (PAPs) in the PDP 2023-2028.""      He must also ""coordinate, monitor, review and evaluate the progress of priority initiatives and PAPs...identify problem areas in the implementation thereof; and submit to the President a comprehensive report on such matters."" The SAPIEA is also tasked to ""expedite inter-agency action to achieve key targets.""      Again, this is something already in the portfolio of the current set of economic managers.      Fourth, the SAPIEA will also be called to do other tasks as needed, ""including representing the President in meetings and such other fora.""      Given the jet-setting tendency of this administration, expect one more person and his staff to join the President's myriad trips - and for whom we need to foot the extra travel bill.      Altered dynamics      Apart from being supremely redundant, the SAPIEA will also inevitably upend the dynamics between the economic managers.      Before, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno was already serving as head of the EDG. He's primus inter pares among the economic managers.      But now, with the SAPIEA, Secretary Diokno will have to step aside. He and other officials like Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, and Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual will now have to report to SAPIEA Frederick Go.      Specifically, the current economic managers (and other officials in other agencies) are ""hereby directed to render full and timely assistance and cooperation"" to the SAPIEA, ""to provide such information and data as may be required.""      In addition, the executive order stated that the SAPIEA will be the chair of the EDG, while the finance secretary will be demoted as vice-chair (the NEDA secretary is also a vice-chair).      I wonder what the economic managers are thinking now that they will be sidelined.      The SAPIEA must also ""supervise and monitor on behalf of the President, the NEDA, DOF, Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and Department of Trade and Industry, and their respective attached agencies, such as the Board of Investments, Philippine Economic Zone Authority, and Securities and Exchange Commission..."" All of these agencies ""shall regularly report to and coordinate with the SAPIEA on such priority initiatives and PAPS.""      Apart from becoming the new central hub on all things concerning the economy, the SAPIEA will also sit in powerful committees such as the NEDA Board (which approves big-ticket infrastructure projects of government), as well as specific committees under it such as the ICC (Investment Coordination Committee), the SDC (Social Development Committee), the Infracom (Committee on Infrastructure), and the DBCC (Development Budget Coordinating Committee).      One mustn't underestimate the power of these committees.      The Infracom, for instance, ""advises the President and the NEDA Board on matters concerning infrastructure development, including highways, airports, seaports and shore protection; railways; power generation, transmission and distribution; telecommunications; irrigation, flood control and drainage, water supply and sanitation; national buildings for government offices; hospitals and related buildings; state colleges and universities, elementary, and secondary school buildings; and other public works."" Essentially, the Infracom ensures that big-ticket infrastructure projects are in line with the Philippine Development Plan, the country's economic blueprint made by NEDA.      Meanwhile, the ICC vets and recommends projects to be financed through loans, and the ICC ensures that such loans won't bury us in too much debt.      Apart from sitting in the NEDA Board, the SAPIEA will be a ""permanent representative of the Executive Secretary to the Fiscal Incentives Review Board and its Technical Committee."" This is another powerful board that approves and hands out perks to various businesses in the country in a bid to boost investments. It's a mechanism of the state to ""pick winners,"" so to speak.      In the executive order there's also a catch-all provision saying that the SAPIEA ""may also be designated by the President to act as a representative of the OP in other agencies, departments, boards and committees, whose functions are related to investment and economic affairs, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations.""  Hanep.       Conflict of interest?      As you can see by now, the new super economic manager will have a front-row seat in all the major economic agencies and committees and boards of government, and, more importantly, will have much say in the decisions of these bodies.      This is part and parcel of a recent trend, where President Marcos has been appointing prominent business personalities in advisory roles.      In July 2022, shortly after taking office, Marcos created the  Private Sector Advisory Council , a group of billionaire tycoons led by Sabin Aboitiz. The PSAC ""regularly convenes and recommends various policies and programs under six sectors [or clusters], namely infrastructure, agriculture, digital infrastructure, healthcare, jobs, and tourism.""      Interestingly, Frederick Go himself served as  tourism cluster head  of the PSAC.      Note, too, that  Rafael Consing Jr. , the first president and CEO of the Maharlika Investment Fund, was previously serving as Go's executive director in the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Investment and Economic Affairs. Upon his appointment to Maharlika, Consing also let go of his positions as vice-president and chief financial officer in the Razon-led ICTSI.      The increasing influence of business leaders in the running of the economy is concerning, to say the least. Sure, many of them are smart and competent. But running the economy is so much different from running a big corporation or conglomerate. One needs to weigh the interests of all sectors in the economy, and not just promote corporate growth and profits.      It's one thing to see all these business leaders give advice to the President on economic matters. But it's another thing to see them appointed one by one in crucial economic posts and have a direct hand in the crafting and implementation of government policies and programs - which could benefit their friends' or family's or own businesses in one way or another.      Remember the setup during Martial Law? When economic technocrats and business ""technocrats"" served alongside one another, but the second group had much more influence on the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, and the legitimate economic experts were increasingly blindsided? I don't know about you, but that aspect of our economic history seems to be repeating itself in earnest.      Is crony capitalism going to be in full swing again, in the time of Marcos Jr.? This is one more thing we need to look out for as 2024 fast approaches. -  Rappler.com        JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author   of   False Nostalgia: The Marcos ""Golden Age"" Myths and How to Debunk Them  .

2023-12-22 15:00:00,[Ask the Tax Whiz] How does the Philippines tax the digital economy?,"  The digital economy in the Philippines has been booming for the past few years. Are there any existing tax issuances that mandate digital transactions?      According to the OECD, the digital economy covers any economic activities that depend or benefit from digital elements such as technology, infrastructure, services, and data.      Under the Tax Code, transactions made within the Philippines are subject to income tax and value added tax, unless there is an exemption. This includes digital transactions. As required under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 55-2013, taxpayers who are engaged in online transactions and their various forms must register with the BIR, correctly withhold and submit taxes, and fulfill the necessary tax filings.      Moreover, Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 8-2022 provides the guidelines for the issuance of electronic receipts or sales or commercial invoices in lieu of manual receipts or sales or commercial invoices and electronic reporting to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). This requirement also includes those engaged in e-commerce businesses.      I have heard that the Philippine government is currently planning on taxing digital transactions. How is that supposed to be implemented?      One of the proposals is to impose a tax on online sellers by requiring domestic e-marketplace operators to withhold a tax of 1% on  1/2  of gross remittances   to online merchants for the goods or services sold through their platform.      Under this proposal, there will be an exemption for individuals with an annual total gross remittance not exceeding P250,000 for the previous taxable year.      Another pending proposal is the imposition of a 12% value-added tax (VAT) on digital transactions, and applies to digital service providers through online platforms such as House Bill No. 4122 and Senate Bill No. 250.      The bill imposing taxing VAT on digital transactions is pending in Congress. What are the possible impacts of the passage of this bill?       Per the Department of Finance, the proposed 12% VAT on digital transactions is estimated to generate P96.72 billion over the next five years. This assumes a 50% tp 70% collection efficiency between 2024 to 2028. A more conservative projection expects P72.69 billion at 50% efficiency. With full efficiency, it could potentially collect up to P145.37 billion from 2024 to 2028, covering digital media and various advertising formats. Adherence to international standards is crucial for long-term benefits. Implementing this bill would significantly impact tax collection in the digital economy, an area currently beyond the scope of the Philippine tax system, resulting in substantial uncollected revenues. This underscores the government's commitment to extending taxation to the digital sector, recognizing VAT as the primary revenue source.             The Philippines joined as a member of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base-Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). What is the significance of joining this framework? Will it address taxing digital transactions?            As the Philippines joins the OECD/G20 inclusive framework as of November 2023, it reflects its commitment to implementing the BEPS Action Plan and participating in the Two-Pillar Solution addressing Digital Tax Challenges. This decision aligns with the government's dedication to upholding tax fairness, protecting the national tax base against aggressive avoidance tactics, and promoting cooperation in global tax affairs. With the country's digital growth, it is crucial to establish effective regulations ensuring fair tax distribution, particularly given the significant presence of tech giant companies.

2023-12-22 14:23:58,FACT CHECK: Ayungin Shoal not being turned into a military island,"   Claim:  The Philippines and the United States are turning Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal) into a military island to deter Chinese maritime aggression.      Rating: FALSE       Why we fact-checked this:  The claim was made in the title of a YouTube video: ""Philippines & US Turn Second Thomas Shoal into Military Island in South China Sea to Deter Chinese.""      It was uploaded on December 18 by a channel with 66,500 subscribers and has 71,489 views and 905 likes as of writing. Similar claims can be found on other YouTube channels.              The bottom line:  The Philippines is eyeing the construction of a structure in Ayungin Shoal, but there are no reports of plans to turn it into a military island, contrary to the video's title.       The video's narrator discusses the proposal from lawmakers, but makes no mention of any widescale reclamation projects or militarization activities that would substantiate the claim made in the title.       New outpost in Ayungin Shoal:  Lawmakers have been  pushing to finance  the construction of a permanent structure in Ayungin Shoal as China continues its acts of hostility in the West Philippine Sea in defiance of a  2016 arbitral ruling  in favor of Manila.      On December 14,  Senator Sonny Angara  said funding has been allocated in the 2024 national budget to build a structure in the shoal for ships patrolling the West Philippine Sea. The misleading YouTube video claims US involvement in these proposals and cites a report from  EurAsian Times , but the article made no mention of the US as a contributor to the structure, contrary to the claim.      There have been calls for a permanent structure in the shoal given the deteriorating condition of the  BRP Sierra Madre , which was  intentionally grounded  by Manila in 1999 to serve as the country's outpost. (EXPLAINER:  Why China, the Philippines keep fighting over tiny shoal )       Improving defense capabilities:  The video was posted following the back-to-back  water cannon incidents  involving Chinese Coast Guard vessels and Philippine ships earlier in December.      Amid rising tensions between Manila and Beijing, the Philippines has increased budget allocations for  defense initiatives  in the West Philippine Sea.      While reiterating the Philippines' commitment to protect its sovereign claims, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the government has been "" very careful "" in reacting to what he calls the ""most complex geopolitical challenge that the world faces.""      Acknowledging ""very little progress"" in diplomatic efforts with China, Marcos said a "" paradigm shift "" is needed in dealing with increasing Chinese aggression.

2023-12-21 14:02:55,Cebu legislators slash Mike Rama's proposed P100-billion budget for 2024 by 78%,"  CEBU, Philippines - The Cebu City Council approved a P22.093-billion annual budget for the city government for 2024 on Wednesday, December 20.      The approved amount marks a substantial cut of about 78% from Cebu Mayor Michael ""Mike"" Rama's initially proposed P100-billion annual budget for next year and a nearly 50% decrease from the approved P50-billion budget for 2023.      The City Council had its final deliberation on the proposed ordinance enacting the 2024 Annual Budget during its regular session on Wednesday - a week after its budget and finance committee chairman, Councilor Noel Wenceslao, said the appropriations should not exceed P50 billion.      The approved budget allocates P19.99 billion for the General Fund Proper and P2.09 billion for the Special Accounts.      Among the salient amendments made by Cebu City's legislature is a budget cut for miscellaneous expenses related to climate change under the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the Office of the Mayor, reduced from P1 billion to an approved budget of P2 million.      Other significant amendments were made to the capital outlay and MOOE. The approved budget for capital outlay for the next year is P11.1 billion, down from the proposed P77 billion. The MOOE was also slashed from the proposed P18.3 billion to P5.4 billion.      The City Council, however, left the proposed budgets untouched for personnel services and subsidy at P2.5 billion and P900.6 million, respectively.      It, however, remained optimistic in its projection of the revenue and earning capacity of the city government as it projected to generate some P98.84 billion for its general fund.      Of the total amount, P77.5 billion will be taken from tax revenues; around P10.6 billion from non-tax revenues; P2.90 billion from national tax allotment; P288 million from shares from government-owned and -controlled corporations, and P7 billion from other sources, such as shares from the profit of joint ventures.      The executive department, particularly the Local Finance Committee, earlier said the P100-billion budget was  necessary to support Rama's vision of a Singapore-like Cebu City  through various projects and development programs.      Cebu City Budget and Finance Officer Jerone Castillo, during a budget hearing in November, expressed confidence that the P100-billion proposed budget would be funded, citing economic indicators over the past 20 years that showed Cebu City's rapid growth. Efforts to enhance tax collection efficiency and update the real property tax code were also discussed.      The City Council, however, asked each city hall department to slash budget proposals and prioritize only the essential programs and expenditures.      It also questioned the need to double the 2023 annual budget when the city government was only able to raise around P8 billion in revenues as of October this year.      The City Council in December 2022 approved an annual budget of P51.45 billion for 2023, which dwarfed the 2022 budgets of the local governments of Quezon City (P30.5 billion) and Manila City (P22.2 billion), two of the wealthiest cities in the country, in terms of assets.      The Cebu city government's failure to generate its P50-billion target revenue for 2023 delayed the implementation of major infrastructure projects, such as the construction of more medium-rise buildings for residents needing relocation and the transfer of the legislative and executive buildings of the city hall to the  South Road Properties .      ""I am with the mayor for the Singapore-like Cebu City, but I am not in agreement with all these budgets... I cannot really, by conscience agree and even for the P50 billion,"" Pesquera said during the City Council's deliberation on December 13. -  Rappler.com         Wenilyn Sabalo is an Aries Rufo Journalism fellow   for 2023-2024.

2023-12-21 14:00:00,Guild pushes for Filipino freelance journos' better working conditions,"  MANILA, Philippines - Journalist Maro Enriquez had seen dead bodies before. But there's a difference between seeing the remains of relatives during their wakes, and seeing someone who had just been killed.      When Enriquez was assigned by her then-employer, television giant GMA-7, to cover extrajudicial killings in former president Rodrigo Duterte's drug war, trauma unfolded that made her question being in the job.      ""That was my first time seeing murder victims' corpses up close.... It was something I did not really want to see, but I had to because we had to take videos and photos of the crime scene,"" said Enriquez.      In 2016, Enriquez was a segment producer for GMA-7. Duterte had just entered office, and it was the  height of his deadly drug war .       ""There was so much blood in the streets - it was so bad. And the neighbors were washing the blood away like it was nothing, like nothing brutal happened there,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.      Enriquez also remembers hearing gunshots from one of the nights she was in the field. "" Nagka-trauma ako sa baril  (I gained trauma from guns) because of that,"" she said.      The hours were ""unforgiveable,"" she said. Sleeping at the office was normal practice. An edit could go on hours into the night, and with a 7 am call time, producers and editors no longer thought of going home sometimes. They brought extra clothes and slept at their editing bays.      The distressing themes of what she covered, compounded by the grueling work schedule, took a toll on her mental health.      ""It was really heavy. It's like being between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, you're already covering something very complicated, something very distressing. And on the other hand, you're also distressed by the work hours, by the experience. So,  parang walang kawala  (it seemed like there was no escape),"" she said.      This was the beginning of Enriquez' journey to freelance journalism. To take this path would mean exchanging security of income for a sense of freedom, but it was a risk she was willing to take.      Because of the lack of backing from a publication, freelance journalists are sometimes regarded with less respect than mainstream journalists. While they share the values and passions of mainstream journalists, some are mistaken for, or lumped together with,  hao shaos  (fake journalists) and vloggers, who drop by coverages and media dinners, but don't produce any stories.      According to Enriquez, some of her fellow freelancers reported being discriminated against by mainstream journalists for simply being freelance.      In a bid to assert their rights and amplify their plight, a handful of Filipino freelance journalists have begun to nationally organize. On October 21, the Filipino Freelance Journalists' Guild (FFJ) was  launched  to focus on the needs, demands, and grievances of freelancers amid a ""changing media landscape.""       (Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story indicated the official launch as October 26. This has been corrected to indicate October 21.)       Two years of ""arduous organizing and research"" led to this moment, where freelance journalists could come together and collectively voice their concerns.       Leaving the daily grind       At one point in her drug war coverage, Enriquez told her superiors that she wanted a break from covering heavy issues to pursue culture-related stories. While a story on mental health was granted, it was not always the case.       ""We do not have the luxury of choosing the stories that we produce,"" she recalled being told by her superiors.      ""That was the turning point  talaga   na  (that), okay, I will not be prioritized in this job. I might as well prioritize myself,"" she said.      After two years with GMA, Enriquez left and began freelancing around late 2018.      It was a breath of fresh air. The flexibility of choosing what stories to pursue, when to pursue them, and having time for breaks upon being paid was something she had longed for while she was employed.      ""We didn't always get to do the stories that we wanted to do. And for me, I realized it's important for me to do the stories that I really care about, not just the stories that need to be published immediately or need to be released,"" she said.      Enriquez is now a director of FFJ.        IN THE FIELD. Freelance journalist Maro Enriquez on assignment in Sitio San Roque in Quezon City in 2021. Courtesy of Maro Enriquez        Living to work       Geela Garcia, after graduating in 2019 with a communication degree, briefly went into the corporate world in the aviation industry. It wasn't because she liked the job - she was financially preparing for the day she would become a freelance journalist.      However, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and she was laid off after a year. She then took a job under content company Hinge, but it closed in 2021. Laid off twice at this point, Garcia felt that it was time to dive into the freelance world.      The pandemic brought excitement to Garcia, who also takes her own photos for her stories. There were so many stories to pursue, and virtually every sector could be explored in how the pandemic affected it. She applied for various grants, and she was willing to use up her savings just to fund her work.      In 2021, Garcia acquired her first grant. It was a story about the  garlic peeling industry in Baseco , Manila - an indictment of the job crisis during the pandemic that pushed Filipino women into poorly paying jobs on top of their unpaid care work at home.      As Garcia built her portfolio and pursued stories close to her advocacies of food sovereignty and the environment, various challenges from her finances to her safety as a woman journalist propped up.      Once, Garcia had the opportunity to join a crew of fishermen who worked off the coast of Masinloc, Zambales, but she considered how she was covering the story on her own.      ""When you stay in the sea, it's going to take one to two days. And they were all men, while I would be the only woman. I really wanted to go because I wanted to take photos. But when I did my risk assessment, even if I believed they were good people, I didn't go because I didn't have a team. Because what if something happens at sea, and I didn't have a newsroom to protect me?"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.      Financial stability also remained a challenge. Unlike employed journalists who have vehicles or transportation allowances, Garcia usually went around for fieldwork via public transportation. All her equipment comes from her own investments. Her friends understood that she could not easily come along on out-of-town vacations.      ""There was a time [my friends and I] wanted to go to Quezon province. But I suddenly got a gig, and we had to move our trip three times. I think the people around me have accepted that if I suddenly have work, I am not in a position to say no, even if the pay is only say P2,000 or P5,000. I will have to say yes, because it's a job,"" she said.      ""My work eats up my money, but also, I don't like thinking that I'm wasting my money on being a freelancer when this is the life I want for myself. So I've come to accept that being a freelancer has become my cost of living,"" she added.      Garcia is currently in Seville, Spain, taking up a teaching job under a year-long contract. She is also taking her time to build networks, research, and widen her perspective as a journalist. While she has more time for life outside of work now, anxiety remains over the uncertainty of not having a job once she returns to the Philippines by June 2024.      ""When I return to the Philippines, I don't know if there will be a grant opportunity for me by then... I'm able to survive now because of savings and because I [only look after myself]. But honestly, my financial situation is not good. I can never dream of owning a home, or even starting a family. All the normal milestones in life I've let go of, because of how difficult my financial situation is in freelance,"" she said.      Garcia is set to join the FFJ once she returns to the Philippines.      ""As freelancers, we're on our own. But it's important for us to form a union for our protection…this way, we can lobby things together. I'm optimistic about it,"" she said.        FIELDWORK. Geela Garcia at work in Batanes around August 2022. Courtesy of Geela Garcia        Challenges in freelance       In 2021, with support from the International Federation of Journalists, the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines (NUJP) came out with a  study  on freelance journalists in the Philippines. The top ""fear"" that the freelance journalists who participated in the study had was ""no job for the next week/month.""        ‘FEARS.' A 2021 study from the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines lists the top fears of Filipino freelance journalists. Chart from NUJP       Majority, or 63% of the respondents, said they have difficulty finding assignments. A typical freelancer has 0 to 10 assignments, gigs, or projects in a month, most of which pay less than P5,000. These also push freelancers to seek additional employment outside of journalism.      Freelancers based in Metro Manila were found to be earning higher than those with employers from outside the region, and none of the freelancers with provincial employers earned above P15,000 monthly.      There is a tendency for newsrooms in general to low-ball freelancers, according to NUJP chair Jonathan de Santos. Around a quarter of NUJP members are freelancers.      Jazmin Tabuena, freelance photojournalist and FFJ board member, has a personal advocacy that all journalists should be paid well.      ""  We should push against the idea that just because we're journalists, only passion will take us through. We should be compensated well,"" said Tabuena.      ""We need proper compensation to provide quality work in journalism. And if we don't have that, we will not be able to provide quality news to the public because we ourselves are exhausted,"" she added.       The need for a guild       According to NUJP chair De Santos, there was a local boom in freelance journalism after media giant  ABS-CBN lost its franchise  in 2020 and had to  lay off thousands  of its employees. This also coincided with the economic downturn during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to many  Filipinos turning to freelance work.       With the increase in freelance journalists who began voicing out common concerns, Enriquez said that perhaps it was the right time for talks about forming a freelance journalists' guild.      NUJP's focus ""for the longest time,"" especially during the administration of former president Duterte, was the political aspect of press freedom, according to De Santos. It was what was needed at the time, especially with the Duterte administration's  crackdown on dissent  and hostility towards the media, as seen in the ABS-CBN shutdown and attacks against Rappler.      Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. - while De Santos refuses to label the political environment as ""safer"" - there is now more space for journalists to organize around their labor and economic rights.       In the near future, the 18- to 20-member guild hopes to organize more members and to make more freelancers realize that a guild can help lobby for their needs, such as better pay, and better working conditions. They also hope to craft a freelancers' manifesto, which will be routed to media outfits to get their commitment to providing good working conditions for their stringers and contributors.      Garcia said one thing the guild can lobby for together is a minimum wage for freelancers.       Freedom of association remains an issue  in the labor sector in general, with trade unionists harassed,  red-tagged,  and even  killed .  NUJP has been a target  of such attacks as well.                       Expert Speaks                          [OPINION] On the ILO probe into labor rights in the Philippines                                                                                         ""Any organization that has any sign of progressiveness to it is being met with violence here in the Philippines. So yes, we are anticipating [threats]. But at the same time, we hope that it does not come to that... we hope  na hindi siya mauuwi sa red-tagging  (we will not get to a point of red-tagging),"" said Enriquez, adding that they are looking to set up a safety office.      Meanwhile, there is a  Freelancers Protection Bill  pending at the committee level of both chambers of Congress, looking to provide protections for the 1.5 million freelancers - not just journalists - in the Philippines. The lack of a formal employer-employee relationship, as well as ""gaps"" in Philippine labor laws, makes freelancers in the country prone to abuse and exploitation, according to Senator Joel Villanueva in his explanatory note.      The bill seeks to lay out the minimum rights of freelancers, which include the right to just compensation, the right to safe and healthy working conditions, the right to self-organize and collectively bargain, and the right to education and skills training, among others.      The FFJ said that the bill is a step in the right direction, but that more consultation with the sectors was needed to ensure the would-be law could fully protect freelancers.      ""As good as its intention is, we believe that the bill can be honed further to fully protect freelancers. This can be done by holding more in-depth consultations, and spending more time with freelancers, so that all aspects of freelancing will be covered, and covered well, by the bill,"" the FFJ said.       Freelancing for freedom       For Garcia, as difficult freelancing is, it is still the life she chooses. For her, freelancing is a fight for freedom - not only for herself, but for the subjects of her stories. Employed reporters often get caught up in the daily grind, but Garcia feels that with freelance, she is able to immerse in communities longer and tell stories from the ground.      In a  story  she wrote about the exploitation of Filipino fishermen in Ireland, she spoke to an undocumented fisherman's family in General Santos. "" Buti may mga taong tulad 'nyo na pumupunta sa ‘min para lang makinig sa 'min  (Good thing there are people like you who come to us just to listen to our stories),"" she remembers a source telling her - a thought that stayed with her.      ""I am able to advance my advocacies as a freelancer better than if I were tied to a job. So in fighting for rights to food, land, the rights of the people in their fight for freedom from landlords, freedom from corporate agriculture... All of it is hand in hand in the struggle for liberation. All the stories I cover go back to my advocacy... to be free of the things that exploit us,"" she said.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/guild-pushes-filipino-freelance-journalists-better-working-conditions/,Positive,['credit cards' 'stocks' '']

2023-12-20 17:17:06,[OPINION] Is limiting warming to 1.5degC still alive after COP28?,"  Has the end of the fossil fuel era begun?       This is the biggest question coming out of COP28, a conference that saw notable outcomes across different aspects of climate action. The decision specifically calls on countries to be ""transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly, and equitable manner.""      With most nations committing to tripling renewable energy (RE) capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030, there is a recognition of the need to scale up climate change mitigation. This is also exemplified by pledges on cutting emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG).          Yet like any other COP decision, it is far from a flawless agreement, especially from the perspective of vulnerable countries and communities. It not only failed to include a strong call for a fossil fuel phase-out with clear timelines; it also included references to carbon capture, use, and storage technologies, which big polluters could use as an excuse to continue emitting more GHGs and slow down RE development.                       Must Read                          The COP28 Dubai outcome, its inadequacies, and climate injustice                                                                                          Interestingly, how fossil fuels were tackled in the Dubai climate summit followed a similar path to how the Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund was ultimately addressed last year in Egypt. Both of these issues took decades of negotiations before a clear decision was made to finally address them, due to developed nations and a few other groups either dismissing their relevance or outright preventing their inclusion in decision texts.       Yet make no mistake about it: just because ""fossil fuel phase-out"" was not part of the COP28 decision text does not mean it will no longer happen. The science is clear: ending humankind's toxic relationship with fossil fuels is a necessity if we still hope to limit global warming to 1.5degC, the ideal goal under the Paris Agreement, and avoid more catastrophic loss and damage.      No matter how any country or fossil fuel corporation tries to delay it or even dispute it, the phaseout is inevitable. For the sake of current and future generations, we must use the next few years to build on this momentum, especially on pressuring developed countries to provide the one missing key that would unlock a just energy transition: sufficient climate finance.       ‘Practice what you preach'      The Philippines finds itself in a critical position after the decisions made in Dubai on energy transition and L&D funding. How it responds to both parts of the COP28 agreements in the next few months would help define its course of climate action in the next few decades.      On one hand, the Philippines has a case for hosting the L&D Fund, and should be part of its Board that would be set up by January. Given the country's status as one of the most vulnerable developing countries to the climate crisis, having either position would provide it a pivotal role in shaping the global L&D agenda for years to come.         But our government has to prove that it has the capacity to host this Fund. There must be a cost-benefit analysis that it can present to show this capacity, considering that it would have to shoulder at least some of the costs for hosting meetings and other relevant operations. More importantly, it has to prove that it can practice what it preaches across all levels.       As a huge part of the basis for the Philippines's bid is its calls for climate justice, the government has to reflect principles of equity and social justice in the content of its positions as much as how it implements the ""whole-of-society"" approach at the domestic level.       That must include genuine and meaningful engagements in decision-making with Philippine civil society groups, who are among the strongest when it comes to loss and damage-related engagements across multiple levels.       This has to also be reflected in how it enacts a just energy transition moving forward. As part of its UN engagements, the country committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 75% within the current decade. However, almost this entire figure is pledged conditionally, meaning that it depends on the finance, technologies, and capacity-building support developed nations would provide.                       Must Read                          COP28 calls for adapting to warmer world without resolving how to pay                                                                                         On one hand, the Philippines has the right to demand support from these nations that caused the climate crisis in the first place. On the other hand, given the slow pace of the climate negotiations, it is important for the Philippines to show domestic initiatives in enacting a just energy transition.      What is missing from either the COP28 decision text or the Philippines's mitigation-related plans is the strong emphasis on addressing the demand-side of the energy sector. The government needs to prioritize popularizing measures for energy conservation and efficiency not only to reduce GHG emissions, but as a means to get more communities and households directly involved in climate action.      As the government expressed support for the global pledge on tripling RE capacity at COP28, it must now translate that into policies and projects at the domestic level. Gas is not that different from coal; it is also an imported fossil fuel. If you want to understand why gas is not a ""transition fuel,"" as its proponents would claim it is, look no further than the current state of our energy sector that is still dependent on coal, a system that has imposed expensive electricity bills on consumers and exhibits major issues of power distribution and flexibility.      The decisions on loss and damage funding and transition away from fossil fuels bookended COP28. They embody the interconnectedness of climate action; how one issue is addressed would impact the others, how global pledges would affect national solutions.       COP28 may go down in history as the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era, but only if countries follow through and double down on their commitments. And that is a big if.       For now, even just barely, the 1.5degC goal is still alive.  - Rappler.com        John Leo Algo is the National Coordinator of Aksyon Klima Pilipinas and the Deputy Executive Director for Programs and Campaigns of Living Laudato Si' Philippines.

2023-12-20 17:00:53,Fandoms unite: How Filipino Hallyu fans came together for AAA 2023,"  For many Hallyu fans, year-end award ceremonies are one of the highly-anticipated events they look forward to. Not only do they feature special stages and never-before-seen collaborations, but they also put a spotlight on the hard work exerted by their favorite artists, as these acts get acknowledged for their achievements throughout the year.       And for the longest time, most Filipino fans thought that it'd be a far-flung dream to witness their favorite stars being recognized in person.       Thankfully, their prayers were heard as the Philippines finally got the chance to host such a prestigious event on December 14, 2023. In a historic first, the Asia Artist Awards (AAA), which recognizes outstanding work in music, television, film, and music in the region, was held at the Philippine Arena in Bulacan.       Over 50 acts -- ranging from veteran South Korean actors and actresses, powerhouse K-pop groups, celebrities from Japan and China, and stars from the Philippines - graced the event.       With such a momentous show set to take place, it's no surprise how Filipino fans across different fandoms pulled out all the stops to make the event a memorable one.       ""This is the first time a known awards show in South Korea was to be held in the Philippines so it felt very surreal,""  THE BOYZ Projects PH  told Rappler.       ‘Filipino fans will always be present'      The AAA 2023 being the first Korean-based award show to be held in the Philippines was already a celebration of its own for many Filipino Hallyu fans. But as more and more artists started being announced as part of the lineup, several fandoms found even more significance in the event.       Filipino fans of rookie group ZEROBASEONE, for example, were ecstatic not only because it was the act's first visit to the Philippines, but one of the members, leader Sung Han Bin, was also confirmed to be an MC of the show. Plus, the ceremony would be held on the birthday of one of the members, Jiwoong.

And that we'd always come to see them whenever they visit the Philippines.""       The same went with  Kim Seon-ho Philippines : ""We came up with another way of showing our love for Kim Seon-ho.

""We couldn't let this moment pass by to let him know that his Filipino Boss Babies (fans) are prepared to support him no matter how sudden and difficult an event here in the Philippines would be,"" they said.       From fans to fellow fans      Although given only less than two months to prepare, fandoms utilize the limited time they had to come up with special projects.       All for Stray Kids Philippines recalled that it was only three weeks before event day when they received the go-signal for majority of their projects: ""By then, we immediately brainstormed the same night about what we have to do, how to execute them, and the whole logistics to be done so we can ensure no mishaps will happen despite the very little time we have.""       Sung Hanbin Global shared that they set up a donation drive to fund the projects that were discussed with fellow fan bases around the world.

""Our biggest concern was not being able to fundraise properly for the projects due to time constraints,"" THE BOYZ Projects PH said.       But as has been proven time and time again, fans won't shy away from opening their wallets as long as they know it's for the artists that they support. Kim Seon-ho Philippines shared that other fans across the Philippines who couldn't attend the event in person sent them freebies and giveaways prior so that they could distribute them on their behalf during the event day.       After the finances were the logistics. Since they only had scant time to work with, the fans were worried about whether they'd find suppliers that would cater to their needs and make sure that all the necessary materials were provided in time for the event.       Additionally, the event being done in a far venue and on a weekday were also other problems that these fan bases had to deal with.       ""We exerted additional physical and financial efforts [to pull this off],"" Dreamcatcher Philippines said. ""It's a collective effort not just within our team but also within the passionate community we share.""       While some of their initial plans - like gifts for the artists - weren't allowed, these fanbases still decided to give it all for their fellow fans.       ""While Kim Seon-ho may or may not know about our coffee truck and fanzone initiatives for this momentous event, we want at least people to know how loved Kim Seon-ho is by his Filipino fans through our presence at the Philippine Arena,"" Kim Seon-ho Philippines said.           HAPPENING NOW:   Our KIM SEONHO PH coffee truck is now being set up *   Outside PH Sports Stadium  PUBLIC ENTRY 5 C – near white tent and pulp tent #KimSeonHo   #gimseonho   #AAA2023inPH   pic.twitter.com/Vph1Kc8Tyq  — Kim Seon Ho Philippines  (@kimseonho_ph)  December 14, 2023            ""We took this opportunity to also promote him and his projects with the aim of recruiting or converting people to join us in cheering for Kim Seon-ho and supporting his future projects.

""Despite all the challenges and tiredness we encountered, it makes us happy and content that both Stays and Stray Kids feel loved through our fan initiatives.""        ‘A huge fandom hug'       Hours before the main ceremony, fans flocked to the fan zone located at the Philippine Sports Stadium. There, fanbases were giving away fan-made freebies and official merchandise, and had even prepared several games for their fellow fans.       It was here that they noticed how open everyone was in supporting all acts - even those they were not familiar with or fully fans of. In fact, days prior to December 14, several fan bases were already coordinating with each other about the ocean lights fan project - wherein fans would light up their respective lightsticks in designated colors as a way of showing support to the groups.       ""The camaraderie amongst fanbases was very heartwarming,"" THE BOYZ Projects PH said. Dreamcatcher Philippines added: ""These fans demonstrated thoughtfulness by changing their lightstick colors to match the specific fandom color associated with each artist. It's truly amazing to see our fellow InSomnias, even fans of a different idol come together, contributing to the overall enjoyment of the event.""         Photo courtesy of Dreamcatcher Philippines       More than that, though, it's being able to witness their favorite acts live and get awards that became the cherry on top for these fanbases. Describing it as a ""huge fandom hug,"" these fans said that it feels surreal to be one of the lucky ones who get the chance to see such momentous milestones in the artists' career.       ""We saw how, other than Stays, a lot of other fandoms enjoyed the performance of Stray Kids and had loudly cheered with us,"" All for Stray Kids Philippines said. ""We're sure that STAYs are very very proud of them. We are really happy to witness them win a  daesang  and perform some of their songs for the first time. It was truly a very thrilling, exciting, and heartwarming experience for each of us.""       THE BOYZ Projects PH echoed the sentiment: ""We used to only see our favorite artists attending these events through our screens and there's always been that small curiosity of what our favorite artists do in award shows like this when the cameras are not on them. [Through AAA], we witnessed their reaction and support for each other when they got awarded.""        Courtesy of The Boyz Projects PH         Courtesy of The Boyz Projects PH       Dreamcatcher Philippines shared that while they never ceased to be amazed by the performances of the group, it still is different to witness them getting an award.       ""It's akin to witnessing our child being rightfully honored with a well-deserved medal. We hope this marks the beginning of many more recognitions to come for them,"" they said.

2023-12-20 11:24:44,"Frederick Go, Marcos' new economic czar, and the companies he leads","  MANILA, Philippines - After over three decades, Frederick Go has quit Robinsons Land following his appointment to government.      On Wednesday, December 20, Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC) said Go is resigning as director, president, and CEO effective January 8, 2024, following his appointment as Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs.      President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. created this post and office just for Go through  Executive Order 49  and is a secretary-level position.      His cousin, JG Summit president and CEO and Gokongwei Group chief Lance Gokongwei, will take over the role effective January 8.      Go also resigned as chairman and board member of the Gokongwei's real estate investment trust firm, RL Commercial REIT Incorporated (RCR), effective January 8.       The 54-year-old Go takes over some tasks previously held by finance and socioeconomic chiefs and will directly supervise crucial agencies, including the Department of Finance, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), Department of Budget and Management, Department of Trade and Industry, and other attached agencies.       He will also sit as member of powerful boards, including the powerful NEDA Board, which approves big ticket infrastructure projects, and the Development Budget Coordination Committee, which is responsible for setting economic targets and projections.      Recall that he was  appointed presidential adviser for investment and economic affairs  last January and was part of Marcos' Private Sector Advisory Council. He held these roles concurrently as Robinsons Land CEO.       Some critics have raised possible conflict of interest in the appointment, and Go's resignation from RLC and RCR is partly meant to address this concern.        ECONOMIC ADVISER. Robinsons Land CEO Frederick Go and members of the Private Sector Advisory Council brief President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on various concerns of the business sector on March 29, 2023. Photo from PCOO.       Go's leadership was instrumental in growing Robinsons Land into a P75.5-billion real estate company today. Here's a snapshot of the Gokongweis' property empire, as well as its major competitors:       Malls       Go joined Robinsons Land in 1992, over a decade since the company was founded. Prior to this, he worked as a business reporter for the country's oldest English newspaper,  The Manila Times . He was also editor-in-chief of Ateneo de Manila University student publication,  The Guidon .       After his uncle, the  late tycoon John Gokongwei  Jr., founder of JG Summit, bought  The Manila Times  in 1989, the clan patriarch asked him to join the daily broadsheet.                                               How John Gokongwei built his empire from selling peanuts                                                                                         Recalling his conversation with his ""Uncle John,"" Go said in an  interview in January  this year: ""I just bought  The Manila Times , I want you to work there...I didn't have the heart to tell him I wanted to be in business.""       After a short stint as reporter, he worked for two years in the sales team of  The Manila Times  where he earned commissions from getting newspaper advertisements.       After three years in the newspaper industry, Go said his uncle then asked him to join the family's property business. (Under pressure from then-president Joseph Estrada, Gokongwei would sell  The Manila Times  in 1999.)       In an interview with   The CEO Magazine  , Go said he wanted to do ""something bigger,"" three years into his journalism career.      ""There was a natural limit to how much we could grow the publication, so I wanted to do something larger in scope and larger in responsibility,"" he said in a 2021 interview.       At that time, Robinsons Land only had five assets. Now, it is one of the Philippines' leading real estate developers in terms of revenues, projects, and size. It has interests in construction of commercial centers, offices, hotels, and residential properties nationwide. Pretty much what Robinsons Land is today was made under Go's watch.      Its mall business accounts for 29% of its total revenues, boasting a total gross floor area of over three million square meters.      As of December 31, 2022, Robinsons Land operates 53 shopping malls, comprising eight malls in Metro Manila and 45 malls in other urban areas throughout the Philippines, and has another mall in the planning and development stage for completion.              The malls accounted for P13.03 billion or 29% of Robinsons Land's revenues and P6.58 billion or 34% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA in 2022. Robinsons Malls had assets valued at P93 billion as of end-2022.      In its annual report, Robinsons Land cited two major competitors in the commercial centers space: SM Prime Holdings and Ayala Land.                ""Each of these companies has certain distinct advantages over Robinsons Land, including SM Prime's considerably larger mall portfolio and Ayala Land's access to prime real estate in the heart of Metro Manila,"" Robinsons Land said.      SM Prime's mall business had total assets of P467 billion, while Ayala Land had P212 billion.      ""There are a number of other players in the shopping mall business in the Philippines, but they are significantly smaller and, because of the high barriers to entry into the business (which include cost, branding, reputation, scale and access to prime real estate), [Robinsons Land] expects that it will continue to compete principally with these two major companies in this market sector for the foreseeable future,"" it said.                  Residential developments       Robinsons Land is also involved in residential development and currently has 86 condominiums and 40 subdivisions in its portfolio. Out of these 126 projects, 98 have been completed, while 28 are still under construction.      Its residential business accounted for 20% of total revenues, reaching P9.1 billion in 2022. Total assets in its residential business was valued at P46.3 billion.      It caters mostly to the young and affluent and upper middle class segments.                 In its annual report, Robinsons Land said it does not have the ""early mover"" advantage and directly competes with the Zobels' Alveo Land, Andrew Tan's Megaworld, the Gotianun family's Filinvest Land, the Ortigas' Ortigas & Co., and the Consunji clan's DMCI.      ""Based on public records and independent industry reports and its own market knowledge, the Company believes that it is among the top five middle-ranged condominium developers in the Philippines in terms of revenues from sales,"" it said.      It also said it is striving to compete with developers in the elite market, including Ayala Land Premier, Rockwell Land Corporation, Century Properties Group, and Megaworld.       Offices       Robinsons Land also develops office buildings for lease in Metro Manila and in strategic locations around the Philippines. It has completed 31 office developments in Quezon City, Mandaluyong City, Cebu City, Ilocos Norte, Tarlac City, Naga City, Davao City, Bacolod City, and Iloilo City. It also has office projects in the central business districts of Pasig City, Makati City, and Taguig City.       Its office business accounted for P7.1 billion or 16% of revenues in 2022. Total assets amounted to P35.8 billion as of end-2022.      The biggest competitors of Robinsons Land under this segment are Ayala Land, Megaworld, and SM.      ""The Company competes in this market on the basis of the strategic locations of its buildings, including their proximity to the malls and residences as part of its mixed-use developments and its accessibility to public transportation, building features as the office projects can accommodate all types of tenants including companies in the IT Business Process Management (IT-BPM) sector, corporate headquarters and traditional offices,"" it said.         Robinsons Land historical stock prices. Chart from Philippine Stock Exchange.        Hotels       Robinsons Land's hotel portfolio caters to mostly upscale and mid-market segments. As of end-2022, it owned 25 hotels and resorts with a total of 3,877 room keys in urban locations.      Its biggest developments include the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn Manila Galleria, both located in Metro Manila, as well as Fili Urban Resort in Cebu. For the affordable market segment, Robinsons Land has Go Hotels.      Its hotel and resorts business accounted for P2.3 billion or 5% of total revenues. Total assets was valued at P21 billion.      Robinsons Land identifies the Zobels' Ayala Land, Tan's Alliance Global, the Sys' SM Hotels and Conventions Corporation, and the Gotianun's Filinvest Land as major competitors in this space.      Robinsons Land also has interests in logistics and industrial facilities and has seven facilities in its portfolio located in Laguna, Muntinlupa City, Rizal, and Pampanga. It also has interests in land bank acquisition.

2023-12-19 20:00:12,How Swiss authorities bungled Credit Suisse oversight,"  About six months before  Credit Suisse  was  sold to rival UBS  in a weekend rescue, the head of the Swiss central bank wanted to inject 50 billion Swiss francs ($57.6 billion) into the lender and nationalize it, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.      Hobbled by a series of  scandals  and  failed restructuring plans  under successive management teams, Credit Suisse had experienced  massive deposit outflows  in October 2022. Swiss National Bank (SNB) Chairman Thomas Jordan and other officials believed the lender faced an existential crisis that could not be solved by just injecting cash, two of the sources said.      Nationalizing the bank would have allowed regulators to install new managers who could restore confidence, one person with knowledge of the matter said.      But Switzerland's financial regulator FINMA and the finance ministry opposed the idea, as did Credit Suisse's management, the sources said. Unable to agree, Swiss authorities decided the best solution was to let the company find its own way, the three sources added.      The episode, many details of which are reported here for the first time, was one of several points of friction among Swiss officials in recent years over how to regulate  the country's banks , including how much deference to give management teams.      Interviews with more than two dozen people, including current and former officials, industry executives, and advisers, show those differences  undermined the ability of Swiss regulators  to properly oversee Credit Suisse, which became the first systemically important bank to collapse since the financial crisis of 2008.      Amid the lax oversight, Credit Suisse hurtled from one scandal to the next. Taken together, that meant when the lender in effect became insolvent in March due to a run on deposits, Swiss authorities were unprepared and had only one realistic option: to sell it to rival UBS, supported by more than 200 billion francs in state-funded guarantees, the interviews show.      Credit Suisse's demise  tainted Switzerland's reputation  as a major center of world finance and a safe haven, and debunked the belief that global banks are safer now.      Better understanding of what happened can help strengthen global financial regulation and hold Swiss regulators accountable now that they oversee  an even bigger bank : after acquiring Credit Suisse, UBS has a balance sheet of more than $1.6 trillion, nearly twice the size of the Swiss economy.      ""Many people here feel that it would've been much better if policymakers had acted much earlier,"" said Stefan Gerlach, chief economist of Switzerland's EFG Bank and former deputy governor of Ireland's central bank. ""One element common to many financial crashes is that politicians are often too quick to accept the views of the largest banks.""      A finance ministry spokesperson said the government had examined temporary public ownership of Credit Suisse but it was not ""the best available solution."" He said that the government was now reviewing bank regulation.      The spokesperson did not say when they considered nationalization nor elaborate further.      A FINMA spokesperson said the regulator started demanding concrete steps from Credit Suisse as early as the summer of 2022 to prepare for a crisis, showing it recognized the risk of a ""destabilization of the bank."" The steps included asking Credit Suisse to prepare for the sale of business units, and later, the sale of the entire bank.      FINMA had alternatives to a sale to UBS, such as a resolution or nationalization of the bank, the spokesperson added.      Spokespeople for the SNB and UBS declined to comment.      The hastily arranged sale to UBS allowed regulators to avoid a messy collapse and wider impact on global financial stability.      Daniel Zuberbuehler, Switzerland's chief regulator when UBS was bailed out in 2008, said: ""It's difficult to decide when is the right moment to intervene.""      ""Had Credit Suisse collapsed, it would have been a nuclear bomb on the economy,"" Zuberbuehler said. ""Nonetheless, it is no success story that we have lost one of our two big banks.""             Early worries      SNB's Jordan started worrying about Credit Suisse as early as February 2020, when Tidjane Thiam left as chief executive after it came to light that the bank  had spied on some of its top executives , one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.      There was little public display of regulators' concern, however, as they phrased any warnings about the bank ""very carefully"" to avoid creating panic, the source said.      Meanwhile, the situation at the bank kept worsening.      In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic caused a rush for cash, Credit Suisse struggled to meet its funding needs, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter.      The crunch, which has not been previously reported, happened as  counterparties  demanded more collateral for funds, something Credit Suisse had trouble providing. The bank was struggling to cope with large clients drawing down credit lines, two of the sources said.      In its annual report at the time, Credit Suisse said it had seen an increase in net cash outflows in 2020, which weakened its liquidity buffers but the bank maintained it had ""strong liquidity and funding."" The details of what happened were not publicly known.      The events led FINMA to force Credit Suisse to hold higher liquidity buffers, three of the sources said. The move would allow the bank to buy more time from regulators in October 2022. Reuters could not determine by how much the buffers were increased.      Credit Suisse's cash cushions also came under pressure as it was hit by successive scandals, which showed poor risk management practices at the bank. In early 2021, the Swiss lender was hit with losses from dealings with a lender called  Greensill  amid fraud allegations. Just a few weeks later, it lost billions of dollars when hedge fund  Archegos  collapsed.      Both episodes led to outflows from the bank, causing Swiss regulators to heighten supervision, with steps such as asking for daily liquidity reports that show how much cash it could easily access, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.      Lack of power      FINMA's powers as a financial regulator are among the weakest in the Western world, lacking some basic tools such as the ability to fine banks, something the agency unsuccessfully lobbied the government from 2021 to change.      That year FINMA went to the Swiss finance ministry, making the case for additional powers as well as the creation of a financial liquidity backstop like the United States and some other jurisdictions have, according to a former Swiss official. A liquidity backstop is a financing facility that banks can tap in an emergency, allowing the central bank to act as the lender of last resort.      In FINMA's view, the liquidity backstop was crucial as well as a final building block needed for any resolution plan to work, the former official said. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, global banks such as Credit Suisse were required to create resolution plans, called living wills, which would allow regulators to unwind them without creating broader systemic issues.      At the time, FINMA did not get support from the ministry, the former official said. The finance minister then was Ueli Maurer, a member of the pro-bank Swiss People's Party.      Under Maurer, the finance ministry had gravitated towards the banks, which were complaining that FINMA was too intrusive, according to three people with direct knowledge of the work of the regulator and banks' views.      Banks lobbied the government to restrain FINMA's then-chief executive, Mark Branson, a former banker viewed by the industry as too tough, these people said.      Maurer, who retired in late 2022, did not respond to a request for comment.      In a December 2022 interview with Swiss television, Maurer expressed confidence in Credit Suisse's ability to turn the corner. ""You just have to leave them alone for a year or two,"" he said.      In early 2021, Marlene Amstad, a former academic, took over as chair of FINMA. Soon after she started, she began requesting information from FINMA officials about supervision of banks, a move that insiders took as a way for her to look over Branson's shoulder, one former official said.      Then, she asked to attach additional staff to the supervisory board of FINMA, which would have allowed her to further increase scrutiny of Branson's team. This executive staff function was eventually not established after FINMA officials resisted, the former official said.      A few months later, Branson left to go to German regulator Bafin. His departure heralded a shake-up that saw the departure of key supervisors responsible for banks and the winding up of troubled lenders.      The FINMA spokesperson said Amstad did not interfere in supervisory work but rearranged the supervisory board's activity to focus on fewer topics, deepening their understanding of those. The board itself had decided not to pursue the idea of additional staff and the agency's staffing had not fluctuated much for years, the spokesperson said.      Bank run      For regulators, the red lights started flashing in October last year, when a social media post from a journalist that a ""major international investment bank is on the brink"" led to a run on Credit Suisse, two of the sources said.      During the weeks that followed, customers pulled out more than 100 billion francs.      FINMA set up a crisis group, one of the sources said. The regulator also instructed Credit Suisse to prepare contingency plans, including data rooms for a sale of some or all of the business, one source said.      The FINMA spokesperson confirmed the regulator had asked the bank to prepare for a sale.      But FINMA was not in favor of Jordan's suggestion of nationalizing the bank. One of the sources said FINMA felt replacing the top layer of management would not be effective as its problems went much deeper.      It would be easier for UBS, which could shake up management ranks better than the government could, the source said.      There were also limits to what FINMA could make the bank do. Thanks in part to the buffers put in place during the pandemic, the cash numbers that Credit Suisse reported were within most regulatory requirements, undermining regulators' ability to force the bank's hand, three of the sources said.      Still, Credit Suisse said in October 2022 that clients had pulled funds at a pace that saw the lender breach some regulatory requirements for liquidity. Reuters could not learn additional details about the breaches.      Credit Suisse management sought to soldier on without support, a bank executive said. Fearing that news of an emergency funding would leak and trigger disaster, executives warned regulators of the bad ""signal"" such a move would send, according to one of the sources, who is a former Swiss official.      Despite preparing various press releases to announce a possible central bank facility, illustrating how close it came, the bank ultimately refused, three of the sources said.      Credit Suisse went on to raise $4.2 billion from investors by selling shares later that year. Then withdrawals started to ease, defusing the immediate pressure.      But the calm was brief.      As a  regional US banking crisis  spread to Europe in March, depositors worried about the safety of their money started withdrawing billions from Credit Suisse once again.      Credit Suisse sought to shore up its finances. Now, it wanted regulators' help. It calculated that  a lifeline of 50 billion francs from the SNB  would be enough, according to a Credit Suisse executive with direct knowledge of the matter.      In a scramble for foreign currencies, the SNB turned to the US Federal Reserve, using a little-known line of funding to withdraw about $60 billion, the maximum allowed, without publicity, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.      The Fed declined to comment.             As the SNB dashed to plug funding holes in a desperate bid to keep Credit Suisse afloat, the head of a little-known group of politicians in charge of emergency taxpayer funds, Ursula Schneider Schuttel, received a phone call.      Credit Suisse needed cash - fast.      The new Swiss finance minister, Karin Keller-Sutter, told Schneider Schuttel in a call on the evening of March 16, a Thursday, that they would have to sign off as much money as needed to save Credit Suisse. The country's financial and economic stability depended on it, she told the Social Democratic politician, according to a source familiar with the matter.      Schneider Schuttel had not been asked for help a few months prior, in October, but now they had to be ready by that weekend.      ""It was a blank check,"" the source said. ""We were told to get ready to approve the funds, but we didn't know how much.""      That Sunday, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion francs in stock,  with assistance from the Swiss government .      ""After we rescued UBS, the promise was never would this happen again,"" Zuberbuehler said. ""It has happened again.""  - Rappler.com        $1 = 0.8677 Swiss francs   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/how-switzerland-authorities-bungled-credit-suisse-oversight/,Negative,['loans' 'retirement' 'insurance']
2023-12-19 19:00:12,Ukraine economy heads for tough 2024 as Western aid concerns grow,"   Ukraine's embattled economy  can weather the next few months until foreign aid arrives, but 2024 is certain to be tougher than this year and Kyiv will need to rely more heavily on its own resources.      Ukraine hopes to plug next year's $43-billion budget deficit mostly with  foreign financial aid  including 18.5 billion euros from the European Union and more than $8 billion from a US package that also contains vital military assistance.      Both packages have been blocked so far - by Republicans in the US Congress and by Hungary in the European Union - but should eventually pass, though a question mark lingers over US financial aid, economists and foreign diplomats said.      Since Russia invaded in February 2022, Kyiv has plowed all of its revenue into defense and the military, while spending on everything from pensions to social payments, has been covered by tens of billions of dollars of foreign aid.      Kyiv could fall several billion dollars short of its financing needs in 2024 but a $10-billion shortfall would create problems for macroeconomic stability and its  International Monetary Fund (IMF)  program, said Olena Bilan, Dragon Capital's chief economist.      The IMF - which approved a new $900-million tranche this month - requires firm financing assurances for the next 12 months, so a substantial decline in external financing could call its program into question, she said.      ""The government has a liquidity reserve for January and February,"" said Yurii Haidai, senior economist at the Centre for Economic Strategy, a think tank in Kyiv.      Filling a gaping hole in the budget could force Ukraine to hike taxes, which would be counterproductive for the economy, or even print money for the budget, which would also come with risks, Dragon Capital's Bilan told Reuters.      Central Bank Governor Andriy Pyshnyi has made clear that printing money would be an extreme measure and one they do not plan to resort to this year.      Ukraine also needs to find a way to restructure about $20 billion in international debt next year after sovereign bondholders agreed to a two-year payment freeze in August 2022.      Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko said the government hoped to secure foreign financing in full in 2024, but added that if the war lasted longer, then ""the scenario will include the need to adapt to new conditions.""      Economy to grow but risks high      The economy is on course to grow around 5% this year after  contracting by almost a third last year . Inflation has fallen to single digits, foreign reserves are near historic highs, and foreign aid has arrived regularly this year.       Ukrainian businesses  and foreign businesses have adapted to new wartime realities with some even announcing new production facilities in central and western regions, far from the fighting in the more heavily industrial east and south.      Nestle invested 40 million Swiss francs (about $46 million) in a new facility in western Volyn region while German drugs-to-pesticides giant Bayer planned to invest 60 million euros from 2023 onwards in corn seed production in central Zhytomyr region.      But despite modest signs of recovery this year, the commodity-driven economy is still smaller than it was before the war, and risks and other constraints remain high.      Millions of Ukrainians remain abroad after fleeing the invasion, prompting many businesses to complain about a shortage of workers, especially for highly skilled positions.      The economy is also held back by Russian attempts to blockade the Black Sea, although a Ukrainian shipping route set up in defiance of Moscow this summer has helped  commodities exports  and may visibly boost growth next year, economists say.      Uncertainty over the direction of the war persists, and logistics for exports remain disrupted with refugees still abroad. The National Institute of Agrarian Economics said transport and logistics problems led to a 7% year-on-year drop in agrarian product exports in November and pushed up imported food costs. Food accounts for 60% of Ukraine's exports.      The Kyiv-based ICU investment house sees growth easing to 5% in 2024 after 5.8% this year, with inflation expected to pick up next year. Dragon Capital expects gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by about 4% in 2024 after 5.2% this year.      Kyiv is also certain to remain dependent on foreign financing despite concerns Western financial support might be waning, economists said.      ""We see the deficit [before foreign aid and loans] exceeding 10% of GDP at least until 2027, and going below 5% only beyond 2030,"" ICU said in a research note.      Ukraine's trade deficit ballooned to $22.3 billion in the first 10 months of 2023, a record high that illustrated how imports were surging while exports remained weak.      This month, Marchenko called on the public to cut consumption of imported goods in comments published by Ukraine's LB.UA outlet.      He said putting the economy on a war footing meant not only building up the military industry but also the public's understanding of the situation.      ""This reality will need to be corrected if we want to go on a military footing. It is a limit on public consumption,"" he said.      ""If we do not draw conclusions, the economy will draw them on its own - as a rule, quite quickly and painfully.""  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/ukraine-economy-heads-tough-2024-western-aid-concerns-grow/,Neutral,['loans' 'stocks' '']
2023-12-19 18:36:32,Romualdez says unprogrammed funds can augment gov't social programs,"  MANILA, Philippines -- Amid calls to scrap the P731-billion worth of unprogrammed funds in the 2024 national expenditure program, House Speaker Martin Romualdez explained that it would be used to augment the government's social amelioration programs.      In an interview with DZBB SuperRadyo on Tuesday, December 19, Romualdez said the funds would help build ""safety nets"" for Filipinos amid the rising cost of living. This is on top of the P500 billion already allocated to assist millions of low-income families in the country.      "" [Ito ay] para maka-augment at reinforce... kasi ito ang nakikita natin na importansya po ng ating budget efforts ay tulong talaga sa poorest of the poor tsaka 'yung very, very vulnerable sa inflationary effects ng pagtataas ng bilihin ,"" Romualdez said.      (This will augment and reinforce [our programs].... because giving help to the poorest of the poor and those who are very, very vulnerable to the inflationary effects of price hikes is important in our efforts to budget.)      Unprogrammed appropriations or standby funds usually stem from the government exceeding revenues and when the country gets additional grants from foreign funds, according to the  Department of Budget and Management . These may be used to finance the administration's priority programs.      "" Hindi 'yan dadaan pa sa bidding, hindi 'yan dadaan sa kung anong proseso. Diretso sa ating mga taumbayan na nahihirapan, "" Romualdez said.      (These funds will not go through bidding anymore, there won't be additional processes. This will go straight to our struggling countrymen.)       A couple of lawmakers  from both houses of Congress flagged the P449-billion increase in the proposed unprogrammed funds. In the House of Representatives' version of the 2024 budget, only P281.9 billion was allocated to the funds.      Gabriela Woman's Party Representative Arlene Brosas called it a ""Marcosian standby pork"" kept ahead of the upcoming midterm polls.      ""This certainly dwarfs the total confidential funds in the final budget,"" she said in a statement last week, adding that it is also bigger than the budgets for the Department of Labor and Employment, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the Department of Health combined.       Romualdez said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is slated to sign the country's 2024 budget program by Wednesday, December 20. – Rappler.com  ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/romualdez-says-unprogrammed-funds-can-augment-government-social-programs/,Positive,['stocks' '' '']
2023-12-19 10:12:56,"Approved Dalton Pass alternative road will connect Cagayan Valley, CAR by 2031","  MANILA, Philippines - The recently approved Dalton Pass East Alignment Road has the ambitious goal of improving connectivity between Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Autonomous Region through a 23-kilometer alternative road that will bypass the existing Dalton Pass.      The current Dalton Pass - or Balete Pass - is a decades-old road that winds through the mountains between Nueva Ecija and Nueva Vizcaya. It also acts as the only arterial road connecting northern Luzon to Metro Manila. A study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) found that traffic volume has already reached capacity in 2019.      Over the years, Dalton Pass has been plagued by road closures due to landslides and earthquakes, isolating provinces for stretches of time. JICA noted that the Dalton Pass is ""extremely vulnerable"" to natural disasters and is often shut down by earthquakes and typhoons.       The mountain road, with its hairpin curves and steep gradient, was also found to be ""extremely difficult"" to traverse. In 2017, for instance, 541 accidents happened along Dalton Pass, with 21 of them being fatal and 118 being severe.      A new road      According to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the new Dalton Pass East Alternative Road will ""address the constant dilemma of frequent closure of the existing Dalton Pass due to natural disasters faced by travelers between Nueva Ecija and Nueva Vizcaya to the Cagayan Valley Region.""      The proposed project will serve as an alternative road to Dalton Pass, decongesting it while also connecting San Jose, Nueva Ecija, and Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya. It will be made up of a four-lane 23.5-kilometer road with a twin-tube long-distance tunnel and 10 bridges.      The National Economic and Development Authority announced the approval of the project, which is part of its list of infrastructure flagship projects, on December 14. The government expects the new road to be crucial in promoting transport and economic activity in the regions, especially with Cagayan Valley being a major producer of rice and corn.      The P64.7-billion road project, expected to be completed by 2031, is co-planned and financed by the JICA, one of the country's historical providers of official development assistance. The DPWH also said it hopes to leverage ""Japanese technologies and experiences"" in the excavation and construction of mountain tunnels, as well as for communication, ventilations systems, and operation and maintenance.      The preparatory survey for the Dalton Pass East Alternative Road began in October 2019 while discussions with JICA's pre-appraisal team concluded on July 3, 2023. Civil works for the project is scheduled to last from 2026 to 2031.  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/business/approved-dalton-pass-alternative-road-will-connect-cagayan-valley-car-2031/,Neutral,['stocks' '' '']
2023-12-18 20:05:58,FAST FACTS: Frederick Go to head Marcos' new investment affairs office,"  MANILA, Philippines - President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has created an office for his Presidential Adviser on Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick D. Go.      The new Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs (OSAPIEA) is established by virtue of Executive Order Number 49, which was signed by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin on Friday, December 15, and published on Monday, December 18.      Go will have the rank of secretary, per EO 49      As SAPIEA, Go will serve as chairperson of the Economic Development Group (EDG), which consists of numerous government agencies.        Previously , it was the finance chief who oversaw the EDG, but following the release of the EO, Department of Finance Secretary (DOF) Benjamin Diokno will slide down to vice chair, alongside National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan.

The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) added that the OSAPIEA will ensure that investment pledges secured abroad materialize.       The release of the EO comes as Malacanang boasts of the P14.5 billion in total investment commitments that the Marcos administration secured in its latest visit to Japan. Go added that P169 billion in investment pledges from Marcos' first Japan trip in February have been actualized.      Other powers and functions of Go, as per the memo, include:        Provide the President with relevant and strategic advice on economic concerns      Identify priority programs, activities, and projects in the Philippine Development Plan 2023 to 2028      Speed up interagency action to meet key targets        Go with the Marcos administration since start of the year      Go officially became presidential adviser in  January  2023.

2023-12-18 16:09:25,Accidental strategies: Lessons from Scarborough and Subic,"  As the year comes to a close, I offer some reflections on strategic thinking in the Philippines or, really, the lack of it. These thoughts come to mind as we see the acceleration of China's provocations in the West Philippine Sea, particularly in  Scarborough Shoal  (Bajo de Masinloc) and  Second Thomas Shoal  (Ayungin).       What will the Philippines do to protect these flashpoints in the long term, and how will it avert a violent confrontation with China? What creative thinking is going on about BRP Sierra Madre beyond the occasional repair of its insides?      In the years past, it's as if our policymakers stumbled into making certain decisions, simply reacting to the gravity of events. They thought in election cycles, every six years, narrowing their fields of vision.      To refresh our memories, I will go back to two major events that shaped part of the national security policy, hoping to remind our leaders that strategic decisions have to be made now--and not when a crisis is about to unfold.      One happened in 2012, during a crisis, and the other in 2019, with a foreign investment gone awry. The first eventually strengthened the Philippine Coast Guard and thrust it into a pivotal role in the West Philippine Sea, and the other led the Navy to its long overdue home, the government making up for years of neglect. This also allowed the Navy to beef up its territorial defense in the West Philippine Sea.      One:  Scarborough crisis and the Coast Guard       It was in 2012 when China and the Philippines engaged in a tense standoff over  Scarborough   Shoal  that lasted over a month. It ended with China seizing Scarborough which is part of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone or EEZ.      The crisis began when the Navy tried to accost Chinese fishermen poaching yet again in Scarborough. This was a routine mission for the Navy, having been deputized by the government to perform duties of the Coast Guard which, at the time, did not have enough ships.      But China did something different. For the first time, it called the world's attention to the Philippines' use of the Navy, sending a warship to perform a civilian law-enforcement function. It portrayed the Philippines as an aggressor.      Immediately, Manila sought to ease the tension and pulled out the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, then the crown jewel of the Navy, its fastest ship at the time. The Coast Guard jumped in and sent its ten-year-old search-and-rescue vessel, the BRP Pampanga.      This was the Coast Guard's baptism of fire. The BRP Pampanga was unprepared. Its fresh water supply was limited and Its desalination plant was badly in need of repair or replacement. Of the four binoculars on the ship, one was borrowed, the other was unreliable, while the others had cloudy vision.      The state of BRP Pampanga showed that the government didn't give the Coast Guard much attention despite the fact that the maritime law-enforcement demands were enormous. The  Philippines , after all, is one of the top ten countries in the world with the longest coastlines.       Moreover, the Coast Guard's role was eclipsed by the Navy which traditionally dominated sea patrol. These two services were also embroiled in a long-standing turf war. After all, the Coast Guard used to be part of the Navy. It left its mothership in 1998 but its transition to a civilian agency was not easy. Thus, even 14 years later during the Scarborough standoff, the Coast Guard was still ill-equipped.      But the standoff changed the fortunes of the Coast Guard. Then-President Benigno Aquino III started to upgrade the Coast Guard, initiating an Official Development Assistance loan from Japan for  ten patrol vessels .  His successor, Rodrigo Duterte, continued this. Today, Marcos is on the same track, recently approving the purchase of five more  patrol vessels  from Japan.       The Coast Guard has since surged to the frontlines of the West Philippine Sea, a long way from the days when it drifted on the periphery.      Two: Hanjin's bankruptcy and the Navy's home      It is hard to believe that, for decades, the Navy didn't have its own base with a harbor where its frigates could dock. Through the years, their ships squatted in commercial ports like the North and South Harbors in Manila, as well as in Davao and Zamboanga.        It only dawned on me, while doing research for an upcoming book on China and the Philippines during the Duterte years, that our Navy had been homeless. Think about this: A maritime country with a Navy that borrowed berths. I had difficulty letting this fact sink in.      Having their own home wasn't on their near-term horizon. But the bankruptcy of Hanjin shipyard in Subic in 2019 became an opportunity for the Navy. When Chinese companies showed interest in taking over the shipyard, the  Navy  acted immediately to foil this.      They proposed to then-Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana that the Navy set up its base at the 300-hectare shipyard in Subic.  Lorenzana  brought this up with Duterte during a command conference of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Malacanang. Duterte then called in Carlos Dominguez, then finance secretary, to cobble a deal, together with Teodoro Locsin Jr., then foreign affairs secretary, and Babe Romualdez, ambassador to the US.      It took almost three years to negotiate an agreement with a US private equity company, Cerberus Capital Management. Finally, in May 2022, the Navy took over 90 hectares of the shipyard, leasing it from  Cerberus .      The Navy's capital ships--their most modern and the latest in their inventory--now have a berthing place, facing the West Philippine Sea.      Let me know what you think.

2023-12-17 13:45:16,"The COP28 Dubai outcome, its inadequacies, and climate injustice ","  The 28th Conference of Parties was held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. However, the official end of the plenary was on December 13th. Advertisements and inspirational quotes were seen plastered all over the city, urging people to ""make a change."" All eyes were on Dubai as almost 70,000 participants in COP28 from all over the world anxiously awaited the establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund and the outcome of the first Global Stocktake (GST).       The Klima Team of Manila Observatory (MO) was in Dubai during the whole length of COP28, and this is our preliminary analysis of the outcome. We were there as a member of Allied for Climate Transformation by 2025 (ACT2025), a consortium of think tanks and experts elevating the needs and priorities of vulnerable developing countries to deliver ambitious, balanced, just, and equitable outcomes at the UN climate negotiations and chart a path toward greater global solidarity. Our work in COP28 was also supported, among others, by The Samdhana Institute.       Several MO affiliated scientists were members of the Philippine Delegation. One of them - Monica Ortiz - co-authored this article but in her personal capacity. Nothing we say here should be attributed as an official Philippine position.      What is the Global Stocktake?      The Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake (GST) is a unique opportunity to drive global climate action and support and increase global cooperation on long-term climate goals. Designed to take place every five years, it aims to create evidence-based collective learning to inform future decisions and ramp up necessary climate action and support, both nationally and globally. The GST aims to inform countries' new climate plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), in 2025 and every five years thereafter.       The first Global Stocktake (GST) was launched in 2021 and concluded in December 2023 at the UN Climate Conference in Dubai (COP28).       In June 2023, Parties concluded the technical assessment phase of the GST and launched the final, political phase of the GST, known as the ""consideration of outputs."" The final synthesis report for the technical assessment phase was issued in September 2023 and highlighted 17 key findings that informed the negotiated outcomes of the GST at COP28.       The synthesis report found that climate action and ambition have increased since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, with progress seen across all fronts. However, scale, depth, and pace are not in keeping with a 1.5degC pathway that ensures a climate-resilient future.                        Must Watch                          The Green Report: Is COP28 really the ‘beginning of end' for fossil fuels?                                                                                         Fossil phase-out language      In Dubai, in the earlier drafts of the GST, ""fossil fuel phase-out"" was included in the language. However, on the morning of December 13th, the fifth draft of the GST was released, and much to the dismay of many, the language had changed. Instead of the much anticipated (and expected) language of fossil fuel phase-out, the language took a much more conservative stance, stating that Parties are being called on to   transition away   from fossil fuels in energy systems.      This language is much more suggestive than it is definitive. It is understandable that many civil society organizations in the Philippines were disappointed with this outcome. It seems that the text favors only a few, when it should be favoring all - it almost ignores the Global South who contributes the least in emissions but takes the brunt of the effects of climate change.       During his opening remarks, COP28 H.E. President Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber had stated that he was ""focused"" on the 1.5 C temperature goal under the Paris Agreement. And just a few days later, His Presidency was quoted saying that there is ""no science"" behind fossil fuel phase-out in limiting the impacts of climate change. His Excellency's stance on fossil fuels may very well have impacted the turnout of the final text of the GST.       But still, we remain hopeful. It is not the language we have been lobbying for, but it is a step towards the lessening of the burning fossil fuels. It is a step towards mitigating the effects of  climate change. Despite the language calling for ""transitioning away"" instead of a full phase-out, the text did include language that was both clear and directive, including ""tripling renewable energy capacity"" and the ""phase-down of unabated coal power."" It is also worthy to note that the text also ""notes with significant concern"" that global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories are not in line with the 1.5C goal under the Paris Agreement.       We are also hopeful because the Philippine Delegation did modestly well. Environment Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga, head of our delegation, was hands-on in the negotiations. She was assisted ably by Climate Change Commission Vice-Chair Roberto Borje, Environment Undersecretary Analiza Teh, Energy Undersecretary Wimpy Fuentebella, Finance Undersecretary Alu Dorotan Tiuseco, and other officials. Ambassador Leila Lora-Santos and other diplomats were also in the delegation. Finally, we were also fortunate to have Attornery Vice Yu, arguably among the best climate negotiators from developing counrties, in our delegation.      For the first time in seven years, the Philippine Delegation was receptive to inputs of civil society. Among others, for the first time in almost a decade, the Delegation also had an official youth delegate in Javea Fernandez Estavillo. Seventeen-year-old Javea is also affiliated with the Manila Observatory as a research staff of our loss and damage team. This could be improved of course in subsequent meetings, including appointing more civil society experts and youth delegates in the official delegation.      Throughout COP28, it had been emphasized that it is the first time in history that the COP Presidency was a Big Oil executive and that his connections with other energy companies would make waves in the final decision text. And it is true: earlier on in the COP, the Loss and Damage Fund had been established, and subsequently, the Parties decided on the host for the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage. However, despite this big win, it can be said that the strides this presidency was taking had peaked early on. The strong start of the COP waned faster than it should have.                        Must Read                          How the world agreed to move away from fossil fuels at COP28                                                                                         The inadequacy of the Dubai outcome      The Global Stocktake is a document agreed upon by Parties that reflects the status of our efforts towards the Paris Agreement. Scientific bodies like the IPCC have long advised the world of the need for  urgent, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions  to ""stand a chance"" of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is a point of no return; beyond this threshold lies the risk that our precious, megadiverse coral reefs in the Philippines disappear forever.       This urgency was recently re-emphasized by scientists prior to COP28, stating that  ""the science is clear: we need net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050,""  calling for a phase-out of coal by 2050 and rapid phase-down of oil and gas. While being praised for being a pioneering text that attempts stronger language on reducing fossil fuels, the devil is in the details.       The Global Stocktake uses the word ""transition away"" instead of ""phase-out"" of fossil fuels. It only refers to the ""phase-down"" of unabated coal power rather than a complete phase-out.       The text also does not mention stopping approval of new investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, a  crucial step for a phase-out . Thus, although COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber rightly claimed that, ""We have language on fossil fuel for the first time ever,"" and that the best available science informs the Global Stocktake, its language falls short of the pathways clearly outlined by science for keeping the 1.5degC goal.  2023 has already been the warmest year on record , we have very little time to waste to phase out fossil fuels.      Indigenous Peoples      Indigenous Peoples are at the forefront of environmental protection, and yet there was only little mention of them in the GST text. In fact, they were not even part of the agenda for COP28. Being at the frontlines of protecting the environment, the IPs' knowledge must be given the most weight and consideration. It is worth noting that the draft mentioned Indigenous Peoples in paragraphs 9, 55, 61, 63 (g), 116, and 158.          In Paragraph 9 particularly, the text acknowledged IPs as one of the stakeholders in the implementation of sustainable and just solutions to the climate crisis. Paragraphs 55, 61, and 63 acknowledged IPs' knowledge alongside the best available science and local knowledge. Paragraph 116 recognizes the role of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform in strengthening Indigenous Peoples and Local Community's capacity to engage in intergovernmental processes in climate policies and actions. Article 158 somewhat echoes paragraph 9 in recognizing the active participation of non-parties including the IPs.       Hopefully, these are not mere words to show token inclusivity but a genuine show of sincerity to finally listen and acknowledge the role of the Indigenous Peoples in the fight against climate change and environmental protection.      With the agreement of nearly every country in the world to ""transition away from fossil fuels,"" this could mean furthering operations of extractive industries in order to acquire just energy transition minerals. In the Philippines, entry and operations of extractive industries has always been equated to human rights violations especially to the IPs who have been showing strong opposition to the entry of these companies in their ancestral lands. The transitioning away from fossil fuels should not perpetrate more human rights violations but to the inclusion of the IPs to achieve just transition.        Climate finance and just transition      These same concerns are apparent in the discussions all throughout the text - that is, we've come a long way but plenty more remains to be seen. Finance pathways, for instance, remain scant. While the Loss and Damage Fund was operationalized, the current pledges are around $700 million, only 0.2% of the needs of developing countries. There is also no clarity yet as to whether these pledges are new and additional, as opposed to reallocated from existing finance streams. While just transition was mentioned in the text, there was no clear way that was discussed in order to finance this transition - civil society calls for a just transition that is fast, fair, and fully-funded. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NQQG) is still far from fruition. Finance, therefore, remains to be the biggest hurdle in meeting the 1.5C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. This is something that will need to be prioritized in the coming weeks and months.                       Must Read                          Despite COP28 deal on fossil fuels, 1.5degC goal likely out of reach                                                                                         Ways forward      For the Philippines' part, we applaud its proactive steps with regard to the loss and damage agenda item, including its bid to host the Board - which Secretary of Environment Yulo-Loyzaga said the Philippines was in the best position to do - and its acquisition of a seat in the inaugural Board. The Philippines will represent the Asia-Pacific Group for 2024 and 2026; in 2025 it will serve as an alternate member, sharing the term with Pakistan. This signals and shows the country's commitment and leadership in the climate negotiations. However, this is only one step forward - we also need to make sure that the country increases its work on adaptation and just transition, and update its NDC, among others, and implement the work on the ground.      While we can be both optimistic and critical over the recent release of the GST, the real challenge after the culmination of COP28 is how to translate this text into tangible and effective actions that can be felt in the grassroots. It is good that there is more emphasis on the science; it is good that we have started to call out the elephant in the room and the biggest cause of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. But that is just the first step. Developing policies is one thing, but implementing these policies is a completely different monster. It is up to our leaders to ensure that the most important stakeholders feel these policies. It is up to us, civil society, researchers, practitioners, activists, and advocates, to hold our leaders accountable to the text. While it is not a legally binding text, it is a document that will certainly help us to get from where we are now, to where we want to be in the future.       COP28 has ended. The work, the truly important work, begins now.  - Rappler.com        Tony La Vina teaches constitutional law at the University of the Philippines and several Mindanao law schools.

2023-12-16 10:45:07,How the world agreed to move away from fossil fuels at COP28,"  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The  COP28 climate summit  in Dubai started with all the ingredients for spectacular failure: It proposed  an end to the fossil fuel era  at a conference situated in Arab oil country amid overt opposition from the powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).       Landing a pact  that  all 196 countries  could live with took deft maneuvering by the conference host, the United Arab Emirates, along with back-channel diplomacy from the United States' and China's top climate envoys, sources told Reuters.      The COP28's UAE presidency employed a strategy during the two-week summit of issuing  deliberately provocative drafts for a deal  designed to force negotiators to reveal the outer limits of their positions and find common ground, according to the sources.      The top envoys from the world's biggest climate polluters, the  United States  and  China  - relying on a personal relationship two decades in the making - together found the right words to describe the world's move away from oil, gas, and coal and persuaded OPEC leaders to come along.      The details of the UAE's strategy and the role of the US and China in securing the deal have not previously been reported.        OPEC.

Photo by Amr Alfiky/Reuters       At the end of the conference, which  spilled into overtime  and was marked by moments of near-crisis, negotiators emerged with  an accord that called for ""transitioning"" away from fossil fuels , marking the first time in history countries expressed a unified desire to  end the oil age .      In a concession to oil producers, including OPEC members and their allies, the deal also provided an option for cleansing existing oil, gas, and coal of their climate impact using  technologies  like  carbon capture and sequestration , in which the greenhouse gas is kept from the atmosphere.      US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry called the deal a victory for multilateralism, and the UAE's  COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber  called it ""historic.""      Some delegates, including the  Alliance of Small Island States , bemoaned the accord's loopholes for continued fossil fuel use, but ultimately did not stand in its way.                       Must Read                          Despite COP28 deal on fossil fuels, 1.5degC goal likely out of reach                                                                                         Low to high      Ahead of the conference, Jaber - who also runs the UAE's Abu Dhabi National Oil Company - was pilloried by environmental activists as an  untrustworthy host for a climate negotiation .      But he did not want to oversee a failed conference. Before the summit, his office issued press releases pumping up an EU- and US-led declaration by nations to  triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 , and a US-China  cooperation agreement  in California in November.      Scores of countries had come to Dubai pressing for language in a final deal to ""phase out"" fossil fuels entirely, an option to which  OPEC was particularly opposed .      OPEC, which controls 80% of the world's oil reserves, made that clear in a  December 6 letter to its members and allies  rallying them to block an agreement targeting fossil fuels.      The letter sparked worries that the summit was doomed to fail.      ""I think there were times in the last 48 hours where some of us had thought, ‘this could fail,'"" Kerry told reporters after the deal was clinched.      A former lead negotiator for Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Al Sabban, told Reuters early on in the conference that he shared that view: ""I want you to know, that COP28 will fail to achieve any meaningful decisions by the end of the conference next week,"" he said in an email.        COP28. Journalists record their broadcasts at Expo City Dubai during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 12, 2023. Photo by Thomas Mukoya/Reuters       Faced with entrenched positions, and with time running short, Jaber employed his provocative strategy to shake things up.      On Monday, December 11, his office  released a draft deal text  that outlined a ""menu"" of options countries could - not should - take to combat climate change, ranging from using  carbon capture  to reducing fossil fuel use, or cutting  fossil fuel subsidies .      There was no mention of a ""phaseout.""      The reaction in the corridors of the summit was outrage. Small island nations called it a death sentence, the  European Union  called it insufficient, and  climate nongovernment organizations  dubbed it catastrophic.      That was the  desired effect .      ""Everybody saw immediately this was a menu rather than a directional text,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the presidency's strategy. ""And that fleshed out people's real positions and their red lines in a very public way.... It then became clear where people really stood. People were being polite up to that point!""      The UAE host then organized a majlis, the Arabic term for a sitting room, in which negotiators sat in a circle facing one another and took turns outlining their positions - a unique tactic that laid bare the broad demand to address fossil fuels.      The COP28 presidency took meetings into the early morning hours of subsequent days of the conference, and held off on  releasing an updated draft deal  until early on Wednesday, December 13, a day after the summit's scheduled end.      ""The idea was to use the clock to your advantage to squeeze the best deal and put the pressure back on the parties,"" the source said.

But the term ""phaseout"" remained a red line. Beijing, Riyadh, and others would never accept it because it had become politically charged, delegates told Reuters.      ""Very often in a negotiation, parties are too hunkered down in their respective positions,"" said Singapore Environment Minister Grace Fu, who was involved in the negotiations. ""And words like ‘phaseout' became a problem.""      Sources told Reuters that Kerry and his Chinese counterpart,  Xie Zhenhua , mulled a workaround: Use different words that mean essentially the same thing.      Xie and Kerry, who enjoy a warm rapport after two decades working on climate change together, already had a road map in their recent climate cooperation agreement reached at Sunnylands in California in November.      That deal did not use phrases like ""phasing out"" but instead called for the accelerated substitution of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. To some extent, that language described what was already happening around the world, with  governments enacting policies  to transition to a greener economy.        CLIMATE ENVOYS.

""Ultimately, Kerry, China, and the Saudis played a constructive role at the eleventh hour when it was clear there were no other options on the table,"" the source said.      Delegates said the inclusion of carbon capture in the final accord appeared to be a concession to Saudi and the broader OPEC group, which had long argued emissions could be cut without targeting specific fuels.      Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said after the deal that  Riyadh supported the accord  because it leaves countries to decide for themselves on suitable pathways to cleaner sources of energy.      The source familiar with the negotiations said the final flurry of diplomacy ensured the deal would pass: ""I would say that doing the right thing became the only option left.""  - Rappler.com   ",https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/cop28-how-world-agreed-move-away-from-fossil-fuels/,Neutral,['stocks' 'retirement' 'insurance']
